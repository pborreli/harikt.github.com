  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a web developer or a server admin always communicating to download / upload files, then the Fire FTP is a wonderful addon for the Mozilla Firefox. Some times you may not be having enough permission to install the software . Then you may be trying to contact admin or some one to get it. But don&rsquo;t ask any body . Go and get the addon for Mozilla Firefox. Yes, its pretty easy and is a wonderful one . You may love to use it from the browser itself. FTP in one tab and the remaining pages in another . Don&rsquo;t need to switch from one FTP client to browser. Is it easy ?  Another FTP client is the Filezilla. Its also a great tool for web developers. Please do try these and you may love it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of the web developers used to work on windows . The reasons they are used to work are  1 ) Cross browser compatibility : The world wide web is used by different people around the world. You may be an GNU/Linux fan , but people who browse your web pages may be using Internet Explorer. Mozilla firefox is the wondeful browser , that every developer may have seen. It can recognize the css and do the correct things . Safari also recognise to some extent . But what about IE ? hm its a tedious job for the designers and web developers . Some of the css will not be accepted by IE. So when developing a web site we may need to look in different web browsers and test whether it looks the same in all .  2 ) Dreamweaver : Many web developers may be using dream weaver for developing their sites. Dream weaver ofcourse is a wonderful tool . But is a properitery one :&ndash;( .  3 ) Photoshop : Many designers may be familiar with photoshop , and have not tried GIMP of the GNU / Linux. I would like to introduce you the wonderful tool GIMP to the web designers. I don&rsquo;t know whether you lacks any features. But be proud of using GPL or Open source softwares.     <img src="http://harikt.com/images/banners/Kompozer_wysiwyg_editor.png" title="Kompozer a wysiwyg editor" alt="Kompozer a wysiwyg editor" /> If you using GNU/Linux you may be looking for a dreamweaver like editor . Yes there are a lots of editors in GNU/Linux. Some are vim , emacs, gedit etc. But what about a Graphical User Interface one ? Yes, there a plenty too like the Quanta plus , Blue Fish , Netbeans etc. But misses some in each and every one . Recently I found a wonderful WYSIWYG editor . Some of the features are    KompoZer is a stand-alone tool; hence its small size and fast speed  Those who are familiar with the DreamWeaver interface will feel right at home with KompoZer:  &ndash;   WYSIWYG editing of pages, making web creation as easy as typing     a letter with your word processor. &ndash;   Integrated file management via FTP. Simply login to your web     site and navigate through your files, editing web pages on the fly,     directly from your site. &ndash;   Reliable HTML code creation that will work with all of today&rsquo;s     most popular browsers. &ndash;   Jump between WYSIWYG Editing Mode and HTML using tabs. &ndash;   Tabbed editing to make working on multiple pages a snap. &ndash;   Powerful support for forms, tables, and templates. &ndash;   The easiest-to-use, most powerful Web Authoring System     available for Desktop Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh     users.  I found this tool as a wonderful one . So like you to help you , if you are looking for one like this . If you have any other good editors which you know for the GNU/Linux then let me know . You can upload files from here itself , like the one in dreamweaver . Interested ? Then try it man , why waiting over all its free .  Lets try to change the world . LIVE AND LET LIVE.  * The above content is copied from <a href="http://www.kompozer.net/features.php">http://www.kompozer.net/features.php</a> . You can read more from there.   </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of us uses E-commerce sites for online shopping . I don&rsquo;t whether they know how these systems work . If you are a web developer or interested to know how this systems work, you can install and try .  Some of the most popular E-commerce softwares are the Oscommerce under the licence of GNU / GPL , Zencart and Magnento . If you are a web developer especially a PHP programmer , you may have heard of these systems. I have tried these three in my local system . Installing these softwares are simple for any one. The requirements for installing the system may vary . But the main requirements are  \1) Apache ( Used mainly in Linux )  2 ) PHP installed  3 ) MySQL database.  If you have PHP version > 5 it will be good, to install all the three . You can see the basic requirements from the sites <a href="http://oscommerce.com">http://oscommerce.com</a> , <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com">http://www.zen-cart.com</a> , <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">http://www.magentocommerce.com/</a> . Its very easy to learn oscommerce v 2.2 . The main thing I have noticed in oscommerce is it uses the normal coding, not any frame works like zend , symfony, code ignitor or any . I don&rsquo;t know whether its my mistake that it uses any ( Version 2.2 ).  The new version 3 for oscommerce is available. But its still in the alpha release . Its using frameworks , jquery , template structure , multiple product images, JSON etc . For more informations you can see in this link <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,132">http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,132</a> .  Zen-cart is another powerful e-commerce system which works mostly like oscommerce itslef. The main advantage of zencart is, developers don&rsquo;t need to bother about the design much. They can change any code at any time. The change in codes will not effect the design, and any change to design will not effect in its code. The zen-cart has lots of features in the admin side. I have installed both zen-cart and oscommerce. One thing I have noticed in common is the zen-cart and the oscommerce having the same sample datas. I don&rsquo;t know how it came so . I think zen-cart is a modified version of os-commerce. Anyway I don&rsquo;t get time to explore it. The admin portion of zen-cart has options to show the left nav , right nav , hide these nav when required etc.  Since zen-cart uses template engine customizing zen-cart will be much more easy. All you need to understand the structure, how smarty works etc. Customizing os-commerce needs to edit each and every page. Its some what a tedious one thanzen-cart. This is what I feel, and its all upto you to decide the e-commerce system which you needs.  Coming to Magento , the newly born award winning e-commerce system from the source-forge in 2008 , uses good features of the todays PHP , javascript and all. But needs a good server to run this. Else to load a page may take a long time. It has great features, like managing multiple stores. I don&rsquo;t know its architecture . Not able to look deeply . Anyway onething I am sure its uses some frame work.  Magento is a wonderful ecommerce system , that every one will love on the installation itself. But its some what hard to recognise the codes. It has a lots of features. Some of the great features I liked which is missing in oscommerce , zencart is manage multiple stores . May be due to this reason many website owners like this. You can see a list of features of magento <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/features">http://www.magentocommerce.com/features</a> here .  The demo for each systems are there . So if you like to see the demos of oscommerce systems . You can go and try it, before installing the system in your server .  <strong><a href="http://demo**.**oscommerce**.com/">http://demo**.**oscommerce**.com/</a>  <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/demo">http://www.magentocommerce.com/demo</a>  </strong><a href="http://demo**.opensourcecms.com/**zencart**">http://demo**.opensourcecms.com/**zencart**</a>  There may be more e-commerce systems , so if you need more you can explore sourceforge or opensourcecms.com is also a good site to see the demo and list of opensource and GNU / GPL softwares.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It may be with the introduction of Gmail many email providers makes their service free of cost , and increasing their space and features. I was having Yahoo and Gmail accounts. It was easy for me to manage emails by using filters in Yahoo. I looked for something similar in gmail.  Yes, this post is for those who don&rsquo;t know how to move the mails to a particular folder , with out keeping it in inbox. What you want to do is goto Settings tab , from top right of gmail page . Then create some labels, from the label tab . For eg : if you have subscribed for Joomla news letter , then name it as Joomla , so you can recognise quickly . Now your labels are ready . Want to create filters to move your mails directly to those labels . The labels can act something similar as folders.  Now select the Filters tab and Create a new filter . You can also edit your existing filters . When you click on the Create filter , it ask you for the From , To , subject , Has the words, Doesn&rsquo;t have . If you want an exact one, then it will be better to look the mail , for which you need to create the folder. Click show details and get the details. You can see the details there. The from address is the person who sends you the mail , the To address is the person who have mailed through some group if so , else your address or list of other peoples to whom the user sends . If you need selected terms included in that . Add to Has the words , to remove certain words , add it to doesn&rsquo;t have .  Next screen will show  Skip the Inbox (Archive it) Mark as read Star it Apply the label: Forward it to: Delete it Never send it to Spam  Tick the ones you need. skip the inbox will skip to the particular label. Now when you receive a mail from Joomla news group, then the mail will be moved to Joomla labeled one. Yes , this is pretty simple. You now can have the folders as like Yahoo .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about frameworks for more than 1 year . I was having good touch with Jose. I used to ask my doubts and he has helped me a lot. It was from his mouth I heard about framework. When he used to tell about the framework in PHP I was not much aware about , what a framework is , what it can do &hellip;&hellip;.  He used to talk about the symfony-project . When I was going for the first interview in PHP , I called Jose and Victor George one of my seniors who were working on PHP. They gave me lots of informations. Some of them were related to frameworks , MVC etc. I was really new to PHP, learning the basics, so when reading about it , I don&rsquo;t understand much. Many computer science and Information Technology guys may have heard about the commonly used buzz word OOP ( Object Oriented Programming ). When teachers used to tell us, many of us may not understand , what they are talking about. Yes, they will be telling real word many times when introducing OOP&rsquo;s concept. The OOP approach was made clear when I started learning Java. Yes we will not understand just by reading, but need to work on it, to understand the features and all. This is the same case for Framework. But when I started working on PHP , it was really a mess to write codes each and every time for new projects. So you may have thought about resusable codes. Many of you may be copying codes from one project to another. Now here comes the role of Frameworks.  If you are not planning to move to framework, then its not a big deal. Because framework are used mainly for big projects and where security to be considered. When the projects are small , frameworks may consume time. This is not what I am saying, but from the knowledge what I gained from reading. ( Updated : Working in a framework will not increase security , the coder must be aware of it <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />  ) So if you are not using frameworks , you can try the Manuel Lemo&rsquo;s form validation class. This is a great class with good examples and all. You will love the features , if you start using it. Its good for the client and server side validation . Many of the problems that arise to the forms can be rectified by this wonderful class. You can get the class from phpclasses.org .  Php classes , pear etc have a great collection of classes, which you can use and can make a small framework of your own. But what about security and all ?I too was not much aware of the security and other issues, but after exploring each day , I learned something new.  I thought of learning a framework. I was looking here and there , to get a good one. I mailed to my friends who are working in PHP to help me select a good one. Some of the PHP frameworks in the list where, symfony , zend-framework , phpcake, Yii Framework . One of my friend Rajeev is working on symfony . He told its a little bit harder to learn . But I thought of moving to symfony , as I will be getting help from my friends too <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.Not only that , but its being used in the dailymotions , delicious of yahoo . Symfony has many inbuilt functions like testing, security , model view controller etc . It may take some time , to learn symfony. The first tutorial was a wondeful one , with how much ease you can create a blog. Wow its simply superb . So if you know it properly you can build quickly .  Some of the functions are automatic admin generation , many plugins available. I was thinking after seeing the first tutorail , why I have not started learning sysmfony.  Its too late . &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. need some sleep .  Bye and Have a great day .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Internet Explorer is always a pain for developers and web designers. Many of the functions are not recognised by IE . Some people who loves the buggy browser still uses it . There are lots of features and security available in Mozilla. Don&rsquo;t know why some people still stick onto it . Aaah its upto them .  I was looking for a solution for the IE6 bug . The bug was the select box is pocking through the javascript menu . All the other elements excpet the select box will come on the top :( . I want to make it clear. Spend a lot of time to get a solution for it. Finally I was successful .  This was the solution  Need to load the menu above an iframe .Referring the site w3schools I got some helps too . We need to make the z-index of menu 1 more than that of iframe. That is when z-index of iframeis 1, z-index of menu should be 2 or more. The default z-index will be 0 . z-index -1 has lower priority . The z-index property will be availale only when position:absolute is defined for it. When position:absolute is used , there will be some design issues arrising and you need to over come these .  <iframe name="iframeblocker" id="iframeblocker" src="" style="position:absolute; z-index:1; border:0; height:200px; width:50px; top:-1000px; left:-1000px;"\>&lt;/iframe>  So we can make the iframe visible by making the changes to x, y co-ordinates. You need to make the changes through DOM .  $blocker = document.getElementById(&lsquo;iframebblocker&rsquo;);  blocker.style.left = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetLeft; // IE only  blocker.style.top = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetTop; // IE only  blocker.style.width = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetWidth;  blocker.style.height = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetHeight;  The above code should be made available in the javascript menu . You can look the code where its saying to show the menu and hide. On hiding you can set the left , top , width and height to 0px. Else the iframe will be visible blocking other contents . The MenuDiv is the ID of the menu . We need to get the exact width , height , x and y c0-ordinate to show the iframe exactly below the menu . Else the iframe will be wide covering other values of the page.  Some of the features where IE specific. I have referred a lots of site , to fix this problem . Now I can handle this bug. This post is to make me remember how to solve this bug.</p>

When I started my site I was eager to know about it , and I found google analytics as a wonderful one. Yes , they will track all the details of the visitors. Their browser , operating system , location and much more &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  Now you dont want to write code for it . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The webanalytics is a good feature that I have seen for the website owners. You need only a gmail account and a you will receive a piece of code when adding your site. Add this code to the end of </body \> tag of your html. Yes , then you dont want to worry aboutany &hellip;..  But some days before I found another Opensource webanalytics , the piwik. I lost my previous post , which contains the old name . But if I get it I will publish. Let me say whats new in Piwik     When you are just interested to know the visitors overview without much efforts like installing piwik in your server I recommend you to go for Google Webanalytics. If you are a webdeveloper or interested to know how its working or would like to show your visitors your online website traffic , then piwik is for you .    Piwik and Google analytics do the same things . But the code of piwik is opensource and you will be having all datas on your server itself. You can add as many users and all . The piwik is a wonderful tool for webhosters . Yes , it can make a good job for them . If you are interested to know more about piwik <a href="http://piwik.org/">http://piwik.org/</a> visit the site and learn more .   </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are using a limited band width Internet then you may have thought of downloading the youtube videos to your system . Else this is not a big deal . I have searched a lot how to download youtube videos in a single click. Some doesn&rsquo;t works at all. But after a lots of search and all , one of my friend , Krissy of the phpdirector development team helped me to host one for you .  Yes, its totally free , in just simple clicks you can download youtube videos . Before that I was using the one addon with the mozilla . But adding more addons some times makes bug to the browser itself. So its not a good one I think . Its my opinion only. You can do what ever you wish .  Some of the reasons that I want to download it is for  1 ) Have a limited band width internet connection  2 ) Can watch the video even there is no internet  3 ) When the speed of internet is slow , you dont want to bother at all .  It has 3 different formats .  1 ) FLV  2 ) MP4  3 ) 3GP  If you are downloading it for mobile use 3GP . If you need a video with high quality go for mp4 .  Here is the link to <a href="http://harikt.com/youtube/" title="Download youtube videos">http://harikt.com/youtube/</a> download the videos.</p>
