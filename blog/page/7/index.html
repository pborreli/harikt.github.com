  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have already have read the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920001096.do">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a> by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf . It doesn&rsquo;t cover much on the PHP, but its a good book to learn about MongoDB and how it works in Depth. Once I saw the book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do">MongoDB and PHP</a> by Steve Francia I was planning to buy it, and the time I got a chance to signup for the blogger review program by O&#8217;Reilly Media. Its a small book of 60 pages, but a good one. I will rate 7.5 / 10 , a good read for PHP Developers . If you wondered why the 2.5 is missing read on  I have little experience playing with MongoDB and <a href="http://lithify.me">Lithium framework</a> . I loved to give an 8 / 10 for the book really . But the reason why I didn&rsquo;t gave is as its a small book with 61 pages, its really a good way to include installation of MongoDb in atleast one Operating System ( Ubuntu preferred ) . As its not a big pain to install MongoDb in ubuntu its really a good thing :&ndash;) . The author Steve has been working with open sky and now with 10gen, and has good experience with MongoDB and PHP . He has presented it nicely, though there are some places need some more clarifications for people new to MongoDB. Even I say its a 60 page book, you cannot just read it in a 3 Hours if you really start playing with it and understanding each and everything .  Some questions I felt in reading page 26 is &ldquo;If you want to retrieve only the slice itself and not the entire document, you can come pretty close by retrieving the _id and the slice&rdquo; with the example      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &lsquo;first_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;, &lsquo;last_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Parker&rsquo;),         array(&lsquo;<em>id&rsquo; => 1, &lsquo;superpowers&rsquo; => array(&lsquo;$slice&rsquo; => 2)))     );  The above will give you      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )     )  The above was the only example, but I was thinking something more . What will happen when _id is set to 0 like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &lsquo;first_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;, &lsquo;last_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Parker&rsquo;),         array(&lsquo;<em>id&rsquo; => 0, &lsquo;superpowers&rsquo; => array(&lsquo;$slice&rsquo; => 2)))     );  it returns      Array     (         [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )         [zip] => 10010     )  and what about _id when removed like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &lsquo;first_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;, &lsquo;last_name&rsquo; => &lsquo;Parker&rsquo;),         array(&lsquo;superpowers&rsquo; => array(&lsquo;$slice&rsquo; => 2)))     );  will return      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )          [zip] => 10010     )  Somethings like this are left to user to think why its so ? Some example like &lsquo;Clark Kent&rsquo; was never created, nor I remember whether he mentios to create new ones. It would have been a good idea to mention to insert new ones as the book teaches how to do it. The other one which confuses me about Indexing , ie whether I want to run the method ensureindex each and every time or only once Eg :     $db->numbers->ensureindex(array( &lsquo;num&rsquo; => 1 ));  But once you finish reading the book carefully, you will definitely can use MongoDB for your next project . He covers different types of ODM for MongoDB.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>May be you already know Aura Project for PHP recently moved to 5.4. So I want to download PHP 5.4 and compiled. You need to download the development library files if you are seeing any errors. Just do via synaptic or apt-get. I did download apache2 and installed. Its not that much hard .  You can also run the tests, and report the errors to QA, which will help us. But I was facing a problem. Normally the php cli will be in /usr/bin/php . But in our case , it will be in /usr/local/bin/php . I was getting error when trying to execute phpunit and many pear packages. So the way you can do is to symbolic link /usr/bin/php to /usr/local/bin/php .  If you want to run <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/multiple-php-version-setup.html">multiple PHP versions of PHP like PHP 5.3 , 5.4</a> etc consider reading <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a> post and use the script to do the work. A big Thanks to him for sharing it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&rsquo;s Aura project ? :  For those who are new to Aura , <a href="http://auraphp.github.com">Aura project</a> was a component based library planned for 5.3+, which is a major rewrite of <a href="http://solarphp.com">Solar framework for PHP</a>. As PHP 5.4 RC4 has already released and within a few weeks we expect 5.4 having a stable release. So today in the eve of New Year, Paul M Jones the lead developer for Aura Project for PHP officially announced Aura will be targetting for PHP 5.4 + and not for 5.3.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 11th BarCamp Kerala to be conducted on 20th Nov 2011 is IIM( K ) campus at Calicut. I have been thinking to speak on BCK for a long. But this time I thought of going for a try.  The session is on Social media and Business  Not a huge talk , but a small one. Remember I am not a Business man, nor marketing manager and is interested to talk on integrating facebook with PHP on your website, or on PHP 5.3. But this will go more specifically for a PHP Developer and I don&rsquo;t know the level and enthusiasm of the audience.  So this talk is to make you think how you can utilize social media from the eyes of a developer. I loved to make the session to be an interactive one. And I guess the IIM guys, marketing guys, entrepreneurs all can give some input for this talk. If anyone is interested I will show some codes and demonstrate how easy its to integrate Facebook on your website and make you think how to make business out of it.  The slides I prepared to talk on the event is below .  <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/harikt/iim-10274824" title="Speaking at Barcamp Kerala 11th Edition at IIM(K)">Speaking at Barcamp Kerala 11th Edition at IIM(K)</a></strong> View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/harikt">Hari K T</a> As I reached IIM, I didn&rsquo;t see that much people who are in Managers, but most of them was having a technical background. So switched my topic, how you can integrate Facebook on ypur Website. But the slides of that is not here, for it will be soon available as an article in <a href="http://phpmaster.com">phpmaster.com</a>. When I was writing the article I made a playground with Aura Autoloader , oEmbed, Zend_Http_Client, FB-SDK etc . See it in action at <a href="http://harikt.com/fbgapi">harikt.com/fbgapi</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a serious one , that you should never miss this Barcamp Kerala 11 th edition ( #BCK ) .  Opera evangelist Shwetank Dixit is with his talk HTML5 and beyond  I still remember his talk in 5th BCK, my first Barcamp, which was one of the reasons I got addicted to Barcamps. Yes there was lots of others too, but talk by evangelist is something different. You will recognize only if you have ever heard. I am really happy to see his talk in the <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">Barcamp sessions list</a>  Remember the next age is HTML5 , so dive into HTML5. Yes we can start developing HTML5 websites which old IE can also make use of it. Ask your developer to start learning about the modernizer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv">HTML5 Shiv</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was introduced to the world of Internet after my 10th standard examination. Was not having a computer at home, so just browse a few hours a month or around 6 month time. But later when I got my first AMD Athlon ( When I am doing my BTech in IT) , I got a start-up pack. From there onwards I am addicted to computers and internet. I hope its not me now , but the whole world is addicted either with social media websites or something like me :) . So we need a good internet provider. I do have a BSNL landline 500 C plan, which I use less as I move from Cochin , Trivandrum, Bangalore , Chennai etc . I have been using BSNL EVDO which offers a 2Mbps connection ( I bought the device for 4500 :P ) . When I was taking the connection was better, but later I feel due to the introduction of BSNL 3G the poor connectivity and resolving issues was high. The customer service is a hell and I was trying to switch to a 3G connection for I want to buy the device only once or I can use my Samsung Galaxy Android set ;) . Looking for a 3G provider in my locality I came to know that the only one currently is BSNL . Aaah hell , the first thing came to me :) . Today I went to buy a SIM to try different 2G and 3G speeds. The first one I tried currently is Vodafone. I was offered the system to have a look into the demo. Great , and I did some testing Tested Vodafone in Calicut : 1 ) Going for google.com :) . 2 ) speedtest.net 3 ) Opening 2 terminals Start &ndash;> Run &ndash;> CMD {syntaxhighlighter BASH} ping -t google.com tracert google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} I am big fan of *nix systems . But the one which is provided for demo is Windows ie why the commands :) . For people who want to try in *nix From terminal {syntaxhighlighter BASH} $ traceroute google.com $ ping google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} Why I put a ping -t is for continous ping for windows. Else it will stop after 4 pings . Speedtest for vodafone 3G was impressive . I don&rsquo;t remember the exact time , but download was around 2 Mps I guess and Upload of .11 Mbps ( Sorry if it was wrong ) But tracert and ping was taking more time :( . Anyway I thought of buying a SIM and go for a test from my home. Got one , charged for 2G plan , connected :D . Oh horrible . Changed DNS from googles, 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 and open-dns 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 . Oh my hm . But the one of the most impressive thing is just on a tweet they are ready to know and help. That&rsquo;s a caring customer service . Hands of to that , that&rsquo;s impressive . So I am searching for a good internet provider, and you may already have seen lots of posts on the blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> . But writing this post here is I have more visitors to this website than the other and if you are not subscribed to the other one I will never get an answer for my Question. Please do the ping and tracert commands from Windows . Ctrl + C to exit ping , let it take ping for 10-20 minutes . Please share the screen shots some where and comment on the post with the links . Lets find the best provider which can server internet . I am not looking for Reliance connect , Tata Photon like services for I want to buy the device and also its not available in Kunnamangalam also its a lock as I suffer now with the EVDO 4500 gone :) . So you can check in 2G mode or in 3G do let me know . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mercury Editor : So going through the Symfony CMF post on <a href="http://liip.ch">Liip Blog</a> I came accross a nice editor Mercury. Mercury is a full featured HTML5 editor like Aloha Editor . You can download or see it in action over : <a href="http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/">http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/</a> I am impressed on the first look, awesome :) . Fluid Baseline : Another project I was impressed is the <a href="http://fluidbaselinegrid.com/">Fluid Baseline grid</a> . It may be good that you go and look in browser with different sizes. Some properties are Fluid Columns, Baseline Grid, Responsive Design. Go and see dude :) . Impressive .</p>
