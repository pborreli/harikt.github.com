  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all Happy Independence day . As India is celebrating its Independence I thought of writing a post about Drupal theme that I love . This is my personal opinion . So you can explore the drupal themes section for your selection . After learning more and more about drupal , I started updating this . So I may want to say these are not the 6 , but the different themes that I love . Recently I fall in love with fusion .   <strong>Genesis</strong> : The reason I love it are Flexible layout  : Every design is having a similar layout. I don&rsquo;t think there is not much different layouts . The layout seems to be same . The things that changes are color, images and contents ( lol ).  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3823907806_cd0487d679.jpg" alt="Genesis drupal theme" />  You may never agree with me that this is a good design if and only if you know how to change the style of this theme , like adding some nice graphics etc .  <strong>Zen</strong> : The next wonderful theme that I love is zen for as I described above .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2675/3823926530_3bc27ee92f.jpg" alt="Zen drupal theme" />  <strong>Acquia Marina</strong> : If you are looking the design with out much changes , then this theme Acquia Marina is the one I love . I have made some changes to make it work as a flexible one rather than sticking on to a particular width . I hope IE users also don&rsquo;t have much problem as I am only using GNU/Linux. And I can gaurantee one thing that Mozilla users will not be having any issues .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3823909300_b7ecbd195b.jpg" alt="Acquia drupal theme" />  <strong>Waffles</strong> : Another flexible theme by the same providers of Acquia Marina .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/3823910446_072aed37e5.jpg" alt="Waffle drupal theme" />  <strong>Black Mamba</strong> : Flexible 1, 2, 3 columns like the waffles . May be having some changes to color only .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3823911616_402d0a27d8.jpg" alt="Black Mamba" />  <strong>960 Robots</strong> : From lullabot . Yes they have a video tutorial for building your own themes fr Drupal . They explains the developement of themes from scratch using this theme . The preview is available in youtube . I think buying one will not be a loss of money for any one who is new to Drupal . You can see the podcasts and blog and really will feel it.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3426/3823911904_00e7b5557e.jpg" alt="Nine sixty Robot drupal theme" />     <strong>Fusion</strong> from Top notch themes :  <a href="http://vimeo.com/7670241">Fusion Core Demo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/eternalistic">Jeremy Caldwell</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.  More over every themes are free in the website <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">http://drupal.org/project/Themes</a> . So feel free to explore and try it out .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don&rsquo;t know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying to configure my BSNL ZTE EVDO device in Open-solaris . I configured the device too, but there is little trouble now too .  Open-solaris is having a project Wireless Wide Area Network , which is run to configure the wireless networks in solaris . The link to it is <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/</a> . I configured the modem using it . You need to be root to do it too . Also some times when running a command you may not be able to read the complete contents , for it exceeds the limit . So after the command add greater than symbol followed by filename ( I hope you know these commands too ) . Eg : prtconf -v > t . You can use gedit or vim or any text editors of your choice . The documentation is so good that I don&rsquo;t need to tell more .  The below is the scripts you may need to run every time .  pppd call evdo cp /etc/ppp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf cp /etc/nsswitch.dns /etc/nsswitch.conf  The problems I am facing still now are  1 ) Speed is slow compared with Ubuntu  2 ) I can search google , but we cannot proceed to a page shown in results .  3 ) You may need to restart each time when the net is stuck . ie no packets is coming to your n/w .  I don&rsquo;t get much time to look more in google for any helps .  What I think is crtscts needs some other option . I want to try it out and will let you guys know more about this .  If anyone has already configured let me know about it . One more thing it doesn&rsquo;t ask any passwords to connect . Its having only phone number . lol &hellip;. <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was thirsty to learn a framework . It was a tough job selecting a framework too . There is a lot of frameworks for PHP . Good programming starts when you start using frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . My friend Jose Antony suggested some of them . They are  <a href="http://framework.zend.com">ZendFramework</a> : A powerful one by the PHP company Zend . Now with 1.8 there is RAD introduced . Thanks to Zend_Tool .  <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org">Symfony</a> : RAD framework by Sensiolabs . An exceptionally good documentation . Any one who is new to MVC can easily understand .  <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> : Many forum posts tell its easy to learn .  <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeignitter</a> : Many symfony users have switched to codeignitter . <a href="http://www.sajithmr.com/symfony-vs-codeigniter/">Sajith MR</a> in his blog posted also tells about why he moved from symfony to codeignitter . There may be many more guys posted about it .  <a href="http://yiiframework.com">Yii</a> : A new flexible one .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3748559244_ce4acd5e72.jpg?v=0" alt="Zend Framework in Action" />Finally my choice was zend-framework and now I am loving it . As I am new to the new MVC architecture it was little bit tough for me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" />. But recently I found a wonderful tutorial by <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a> the author of the book <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">ZendFramework in action</a> . The tutorial is an easy to learn who are new to zend-framework 1.8 .  I was not person who used to read books in my college days too . But now adays it seems I am reading a lot <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/3747769765_2ca82aefc3.jpg?v=0" alt="PHP in Action" />  <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">Zend framework in action</a> is one of the books I love to read . I hope the book zend framework in action is one of the best books to learn Zend framework . He was the advisory board member of Zend . So you can guess the remaining standard of the book .If you consider buying one , go for it . (*I don&rsquo;t get any money for it , never think so )  I saw another book PHP in action when I was looking more details about Zend Framework in Action . Just looked the table of contents . Yes it also a wonderful one if you are new to PHP .  Also the book is just a starting point , you need to look the mannual pages of <a href="http://php.net">php.net</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/">framework.zend.com</a> to learn more .  Today I found another site which is also a good one to start . Its none other than Zend Cast . Its having lots of videos for beginners . You may love it and learn from it . <a href="http://www.zendcasts.com/">http://www.zendcasts.com/</a>  Updated on 14th October 2009 :<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4008823767_bf58143231.jpg" alt="Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" />  <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a>: I got a chance to review the book &ldquo;Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development&rdquo; by Keith Pope . Its a wonderful book to learn Zend framework and many components . The book covers many commonly used components like Zend_ACL , Zend_Auth , Zend_Db , Zend_Form etc . Its really a nice book which will speedup your learning curve . You can also learn zend framework from the mannuals, but it may be easy to follow a person who is using zend framework than going single . The book covers a working example creating a shopping cart . It also uses good programming practices like unit testing with phpunit , debugging with xdebug etc . You can get a copy of the book from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">packt publishers</a>. Its available in ebook and hardcopy . You will defnitely get the return once you have the book .  Hope you too will enjoy reading the book like me . I have posted my review <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">here</a> .</p>

With in a few seconds I clicked the link to test it .

The google has geoip to find from where a user is browsing . So they can ignore me . May be the coder doesn&rsquo;t utilises those great function . Anyway Thanks to google for the nice invitation .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t know any of you know why education is needed ? Whats the value of education in life ?  According to me , education does&#8217;nt means only knowledge gained from an institution or getting a degree . Its making a person as a human . Many of you may disagree with me . I have found many people who have a PHD even fails to recognise human <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  A best example I can show you that many of the Keralites are still not educated is many people strikes against the introduction of a chapter &ldquo;മതം ഇല്ലാത ജീവന്‍ &rdquo; in the 7th standard. I don&rsquo;t know why every one complains about the chapter . India is a country rich with many religions , that may be the unity of India too . Look our neighbours Pakisthan , Bangladesh and all . Do you want a country like that ?  I don&rsquo;t know who my Ancestor&rsquo;s is . You may be knowing upto your grand father . A man is born without  a religion or caste . But when they grow they are quarelling on the basis of caste and religion . I remember the old song &ldquo;മനുഷ്യന്‍ മതങ്ങളെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചു &hellip;&rdquo; , every one may love the song , but is never recognising the meaning and words .  So guys its time to wake up . Act wise , this is what education is <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All may be hearing about the buzz word Ruby on Rails. So I thought to peep into What Ruby on Rails is . I thought of getting exited by Ruby on Rails , so watched the video <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov">http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov</a> . Yes I was really excited.  But can we compare Ruby on Rails with PHP ? Never you should not compare Ruby on Rails with PHP. Then Why isnt ?  Yes , PHP  and Ruby are two languages used for web-development . Rails is a MVC framework for the programming language Ruby . There are lots of frameworks for PHP like the zend framework from the supporters of PHP , yii , symfony , PHPCake , Code Ignitter and much more . You can see similar examples to get excited in PHP frameworks . So you can compare rubyonrails with zend-framework , code-ignitter , yii , symfony or any . PHP has a wide range of frameworks , does Ruby have something like this ? I don&rsquo;t know . So sorry .  I have read in a blog why Ruby on Rails went to some what popular . Its mainly because, at that time PHP was not purely object oriented. I don&rsquo;t remember where I read about it . Anyway one was in <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org">phpclasses.org</a> . Manuel Lemo has made it some what clear about it .  Recently I was arguing with one of my collegue that , PHP is secure, but you need to code it correctly . He told me that PHP lags security . Yes, it may lacks security when you code not propery . As the web now adays is dynamic and getting information from users, you should properly validate the inputs, else it may cause a serious damage to the site and server ( I agree , its not only the case of PHP , every web <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  PHP now adays have good number of frameworks which will do almost all things to make secure . But its very sad that many of the PHP developers are still using without frameworks . Frameworks increases the productivity . No one knows the working of many sites, but many of the websites are insecure .  The developers need to be careful and should know the attacks that will happen to a website when its live . But many people fails to do the necessary actions. Your design may look good , but it may lags security <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/devil_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So try to move using some nice frameworks .  So PHP  with some frameworks can be compared with rubyonrails .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may forget some of your passwords when its not used often . Its really a painful process for me as I am having lots of accounts . I don&rsquo;t love to make the same password for every one. So forget password link always helps you . You may need to open the secondary email and configure the new password. Recently google has launched a new service . You can enter your mobile number , so the new password will be send to your mobile. So you don&rsquo;t need to open some other mail and get the password .( Or if you have forget the password of that then <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  You can sign into <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/">https://www.google.com/accounts/</a> and add a phone number in the SMS tab . Screenshot of it is attached .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/3710605492_9735670a27.jpg?v=0" alt="Gmail password on your cell phone" />  Note : Please do not give your connection to some one else if you have added this option . Do confirm that the number typed is your mobile number itself .</p>
