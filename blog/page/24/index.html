  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday my friend Jithesh called me . He used to call me , but today he was having a doubt also .  &ldquo;Will I get some money from online jobs ?I have seen various places about data entry , google kit etc . Whats this man ? &rdquo;  So I thought of wrting about it . If you are interested here it is  You too can earn . But read completely with some patience<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . The one source that I am pretty sure is <strong>google</strong> gives you money .  <strong>Now you may be thinking why google needs to pay you money?</strong>  They pay you the money for the advertisement or the ads they are showing in your site .  <strong>What do you mean by a site ?</strong>  A site is some place where you place some contents to the public. For eg : harikt.com is a site .Yahoo , AOL , Rediff etc .  <strong>How can I get a site ?</strong>  Now there are lots of free hosting services . <a href="http://pages.google.com/" title="Google Page Creator">Googles page creator</a> , <a href="http://blogger.com/" title="Blog of Google">Blogger</a> by google , <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">yahoo geocities</a> etc are some services. I prefer you googles page creator or blogger . Geocities will add their own ads. But googles services like blogger and page creator is ads free . They host it freely . You need only a gmail account to start it . Blogger is a nice one , if you dont know much html . You don&rsquo;t want to bother about the html and all . Its simple as you send a mail. I suggest blogger for those who are unfamiliar about html .  You can also go for a paid hosting and get a domain name . If you are not familiar about it the best one is to get a blogger account and slowly you will learn.  <strong>My site is ready . What should I do next ?</strong>  Register for <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" title="Google Adsense">google adsense program</a> . You can register with your gmail ID . If you are using blogger , then you can affiliate to google adsense from there . Else you can login to your adsense account get the code which suits the correct position , width , height and place there.  <strong>How to make your site popular ?</strong>  Announce your site . Let your friends come and visit your site and if the contents of the page helps them , they will recommend to their friends and the number of visitors increase . Dont bother about the payment and all . Write relevant posts . Google itslef will find your site in their search .  <strong>When will I receive my payment ?</strong>  After your account reaches 50$ they will send you the code for verification of your identity . You just need to login and give the identity number . When your acoount reaches $100 the payment is ready . You can hold the payment or they will send you the money in their next month . Have it cheers &hellip;.  <strong>Is this all true ? Have you received any ?</strong>  :) . When I started my google adsense I used to tell my friends to visit my site . There was no relevant contents in my site. But after that I started my blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/" title="Blog of Hari">http://www.ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> . Some of them was useful to others. People came to my blog . Some of my friends called me $ ( dollar ) those time . I was not sure at that time whether I will receive it or not ? So I was not able to quarrel with them. But when I got the confirmation code I was some what sure that this will work .  Finally I was successful and I am receiving my $$$$$$$$$$$ .<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> Some of my old frineds have started adsense now . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . Now they know I am successful. Thanks to google .  <strong>Do you know any other source ?</strong>  Yahoo , adbard.net also is having adsense program . I have not tried all that . So I cant guarantee you .  Mail your friends about this . Let them too learn and earn .  * Note Things you must remember  Never click your ads ..Before joining please read more about googe adsense from their help .  This article will be edited to include a more detailed view. So stay tuned . I will teach you to earn more $$$ than me <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />  If you find this article please spend some time to add your comments or digg it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is Joomla ?  Some of my friends asked me &ldquo;Your site is powered with Joomla . Whats is Joomla ?&rdquo;  So let me tell something about Joomla ,for the site uses it .  Joomla is a Content Management System ( CMS ).  What do you mean by a CMS or Content Management System ?  A CMS is a computer software system for organising and facilitating collobarative creation of documents and other content. A CMS is frequently a web application used for managing web sites and web content .  Is Joomla the only CMS ?  No , there are lots of other CMS systems . Some of the popular CMS are Joomla , Drupal , Maboo , Typo3 , Wordpress etc . These CMS are all free and under the licence of GNU / GPL or in the opensource licence. As its free you can download change and redistribute , and enjoy the power of free software .  What I feel about Joomla , Drupal , Typo3 , Wordpress ? Joomla is a powerful award winning Open Source CMS system. When you install it for the first time with sample datas, you will defnitely love it. Mainly due to the template ja purity . Joomla has lots of extensions and plugins. So customizing the design is some what easy .You can see many sites are now running in Joomla. The recent site I visited is <a href="http://tatanano.inservices.tatamotors.com/tatamotors/">http://tatanano.inservices.tatamotors.com/tatamotors/</a> of the tata nano . Yes build in Joomla. Some of the sites of kerala government is in Joomla.Found finance ministers site .  Drupal is also a wonderfull CMS . I have not explored it a lot like Joomla . Just tried here and there only . Joomla uses frame works. Some from zend is also being used. Recently I was reading in a Joomla forum about the designing of a news paper site. One guy has recommended Drupal for it and he tells although Drupal has ugly templates , making a news paper site is simple in Drupal than in Joomla . He has a list of sites also which runs on Drupal. So I thought of trying it in Joomla , then later in Drupal too. I want to explore some of the plugins in Joomla, also in Drupal <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif" title="Wink" alt="Wink" />.  Typo3 is also another CMS that so many people are using. It uses formidable template engine. If you need to customize the design and all, you may need to learn it first. So some what hard I think. I have not installed and configured one. It has a lot of feature, as the developers itself tell you , you can&rsquo;t learn typo3 in 2 days. If you need to learn in 2 days , you can go for some other cms. Yes its hard to learn, but I agree with them that , once you learn , you will be the master. Some of the features I liked in it are the manage mutiple sites from one backend. Its simply superb . Today ( 26-03-2009 ) I some how installed Typo3 . Its hard for a newbie. Really hard. Though its has documentation and all, its not easy as Joomla or Drupal. Anyway I would like to learn it . Some of the things that I am interested to work on the future are smarty , frameworks ( Zend or Symfony ) , drupal , joomla , wordpress , sugar crm &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. and many more .  Wordpress is the easy one which any one can maintain . Though Joomla , Drupal , Typo3 etc claims easy to maintain and all , its not much easy as Wordpress. Wordpress is mainly used for blogging. When I started my blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> at blogger I found many sites which have used the term &ldquo;powered by wordpress&rdquo; . At that time I also downloaded the wordpress , but I was unaware how to make it work . Wordpress is the first one I have installed in my local system after knowing about it from my college days . It was Dilpu&rsquo;s blog which uses wordpress. Now the site is no longer available. He is not maintaining that site , but now is in blogger I think. Anyway it was he who have shown me the real path . So thanks to him . So if you are interested in blogging I recommend wordpress . You can use Drupal , Joomla etc , but you need to spend some time learning about it .  Will add more contents to it . Stay tuned :) .</p>
