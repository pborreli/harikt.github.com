  <div class="entry-content"><p>Packt publishers who loves opensource have come up with the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">PHP5 CMS Framework Development</a> . I was one of the technical reviewers of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">PHP5 CMS Framework Development</a> . If you are a developer you may have thought , why I need to read the book . I know how to develop a CMS ( Content Management System ) . Ya I agree, well we all know how to develop a CMS . Anything that store something in db, which has functionalities like CRUD you can call it as CMS. But you may not be developing something that we can extend . Once a website is developed maintaining it is hard . So before developing a system we must know how we can extend it , ie what we call as a CMS framework . Some of the examples of the popular CMS frameworks are <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> , <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://mambo-foundation.org/">Mamboo</a> etc .  The author of the book is Martin Brampton who is a former development team leader on the renowned Mambo open-source content management system. Now he is the project leader of the open-source CMS <a href="http://aliro.org/">Aliro</a> . Joomla , Aliro , MiamiCMS etc were forks of the mamboo project . So if you are looking how these systems works , I suggest you this book . A book has its own limitations of walking you through each and every line . So he has covered all parts of the system in a nice way . I have gained some knowledge reading the book . So I hope you too will enjoy the book . The examples of the book are all from the project Aliro , which is an open-source CMS system . So get it while its hot .  Language :  English Paperback : 416 pages [ 235mm x 191mm ] Release Date : August 2010 ISBN : 1849511349 ISBN 13 : 978-1-84951-134-6 Author(s) : <a href="http://twitter.com/martinbrampton">Martin Brampton</a>  Buy the book from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">Packt publishers</a> and you can see Table of Contents <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/toc/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition-table-contents">here</a> .  Still looking for a chapter by chapter review ? A wonderful review of the book is written <a href="http://www.ds-o.com/archives/76-Book-Review-PHP5-CMS-Framework-Development-by-Martin-Brampton.html">here</a> . I am too lazy to write such a long one :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys ,  Hope you have already seen my twitter tweets about OSI Days . Its one of the largest opensource conference to be held on Chennai Trade Center from 19th to 21st of September .  <strong>Whom should attend ?</strong>  Are you a person working on opencource technologies like PHP , Drupal , Symfony , Ruby on Rails , MySQL &hellip;.. If you answered yes , then you must . We all are techies and we know or learn things from other techies and not watching a horror or comedy movie <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . We are all part of the community , so must share and learn what we have , conferences , barcamps etc are a nice place to meet guys of same taste and interests .  I loved to attend the Zendcon and many other opensource conference held previously . But my 2 to 3 months of salary was for the ticket . Travelling expenses and boarding extra . So if you are a person like me ( especially from India ) , who loves to attend the conferences , then you will never get a good opporchunity than this .  <strong>Sessions and Tutorials</strong> :  I am a fan of Fabien, after I heard about the symfony project  some years back. I read many of his blog posts and it was really awesome . He knows how to teach people . Thought of going to zendcon was to meet some people like him ( But failed ) . Now its time for me to see him and not only just meet him , he is presenting and giving tutorials on  the most explosive one , <strong>symfony2</strong> which will be released in late 2010 . Jonathan wage another awesome person of sensio who is behind the <strong>Doctrine</strong> ORM . There are many more guys from the PHP community . They are Bastian Feder, David Coallier , Jakub Vrana . A good description is given in the osidays website , so I think I don&rsquo;t want to cover all aspects .  As the first list publishes , <strong>Drupal</strong> stands first . There are many sessions on Drupal . If you was looking the drupal community you may already know about aegir . I played with it and is really awesome . There is sessions about aegir by Dave Hall . You may wan to concentrate on this if you are working on Drupal . Marek Sotak who made the admin theme RootCandy , Prajwala Manchikatla , Ipsita Mishra , Siva Kumar Epari , Markus Franz ( also session on PHP like hiphop , quality assurance etc ) are some others who are taking sessions on Drupal ( Theming , Module development etc is covered ).  I am also looking for the session on MySQL by Sonali Minocha who is one of the first MySQL certified DBA ( Source from osidays ).  Facebook may have made some changes or forced some of the Enterprise to think about PHP . David Recordon of Facebook is with the session Building and scaling Facebook with Open Source . So I hope that too will be awesome.  I am not a great fan of building mobile applications . So if you are looking for building mobile applications you may want to concentrate on sessions by Dibya Prakash&rsquo;s on Android , Reetu Raj on iphone application .  <strong>HTML5</strong> has already started , and many of the browser is already supporting it ( I remember the post by sitepoint , somethig like this &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait till HTML5 is stable , as HTML6 or someother version may be started at that time &rdquo; . I think it was right ) . So its another topic all webdevelopers and designers must concentrate . Jason Levitt is with the topic . So I hope that will be awesome and I love seeing some demos in the presentation . ( It was in 5th Barcamp Kerala Shwetank Dixit, an evangelist of opera makes it more memorable , so I hope the same may happen here <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />  )  <strong>What is missing ?</strong>  Not seen any sessions on <strong>Zend framework</strong> , <strong>Lithium</strong> the latest framework ( the first one to be released before any others from some of the old project leaders of Cake PHP and some other framework ) for PHP 5.3 awesome :) . <strong>Zend certification training</strong> etc as seen on the home page of osidays . May be coming in the next coming days . Not sure though , if any more speakers will be included .  I was having a wrong thought that many of the developers who are interested in Conferences are Gents than Ladies . But the list corrected me . Nice to see female voice Prajwala Manchikatla , Ipsita Mishr , Reetu Raj , Sonali Minocha .  <strong>What are you waiting for ?</strong>  Yes hope to meet you there . I am looking forward and don&rsquo;t want to miss this chance meeting the awesome guys from the PHP community . Hope you too will be there to learn more about the latest trends and technologies. I hope I have not missed anything , if yes please feel free to let me know .  Thanks and meet you there at Chennai . Oh still more days to go. If any of the speakers are coming to Kerala , I will try to help you . So get in touch with me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  *offer valid still stocks last ( No worries I will be here to help you , with what ever things I can do ) .  Register your presence : <a href="http://osidays.com/">http://osidays.com/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know many of you may be knowing about this google tool. I am little late to play with this. But just posting if someone still missing to checkout . If you was following me on twitter you may have seen my tweet some days back. Even though I thought of writing a blogpost I was too lazy and some what busy :) .  But today I thought of playing with it . Hope you too will enjoy looking the security issues for your website . This is a great tool to check. Its from Michal Zalewski of Google which has been licenced under the Apache Licence agreement .  What is ratproxy ?  So you may have heard about proxy servers .. But this is not a proxy server to by pass any of the social networking websites :) . This a great tool for webdevelopers , web owners or even clients who want to test their website before payment is made. So let me copy the defnition of what ratproxy is  &ldquo;<em>Ratproxy</em> is a semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool. It is meant to complement active crawlers and manual proxies more commonly used for this task, and is optimized specifically for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex <em>web 2.0</em> environments. The approach taken with <em>ratproxy</em> offers several important advantages over more traditional methods:  &ndash;   <strong>No risk of disruptions.</strong>  &ndash;   <strong>Low effort, high yield.</strong>  &ndash;   <strong>Preserved control flow of human interaction.</strong>   &ndash;   <strong>WYSIWYG data on script behavior.</strong>   &ndash;   <strong>Easy process integration.</strong> &rdquo;  Ratproxy is developed from C , ya was my favourite language at college though I am not so powerful in it :) . I remebered compilling C programs from Linux terminals when I was at college .  You may run with errors when compiling it with make command .  Something like the below .  hari@hari-laptop:/var/www/ratproxy$ make cc ratproxy.c -o ratproxy  -Wall -O3 -Wno-pointer-sign -D_GNU_SOURCE http.c mime.c ssl.c -lcrypto -lssl ratproxy.c:43:25: error: openssl/md5.h: No such file or directory ratproxy.c: In function ‘decode_flash’: ratproxy.c:615: warning: ignoring return value of ‘write’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result  &ldquo;  Just install libssl-dev package using synaptic or apt-get . Compile it once again and yes I hope you have done without errors . Download the Quick Proxy addon for the Mozilla firefox , so you can easily switch from proxy to the other . You need to configure the proxy server . Edit - > Preferences &ndash;> Advanced-> Network tab &ndash;> Settings &ndash;> Mannual proxy and add it . Now just close and start your Mozilla Firefox once again .  Run from the terminal  hari@hari-laptop:/var/www/ratproxy$ ./ratproxy -v dumps -w mysite.log -d mysite.com -XClfscm  ratproxy version 1.58-beta by &lt;lcamtuf@google.com> [*] Proxy configured successfully. Have fun, and please do not be evil.     WARNING: Disruptive tests enabled. use with care. [+] Accepting connections on port 8080/tcp (local only)&hellip;  Browse the mysite.com upload , download and do what ever things you love. Don&rsquo;t forget to pass javascript , some unwanted test queries etc . Try SQL injections also . You will be getting detailed report . You can see how much your server is vulnerable . It may be more than this :) .  Report can be made by running hari@hari-laptop:/var/www/ratproxy$ ./ratproxy-report.sh mysite.log > report.html  Please don&rsquo;t use this tool for EVIL . Do it for good to make a wonderful web tomorrow . I love good techniques and good people . If you are trying to crack I may call you a F*cker . Hope you enjoyed the new tool to fix the issues .  You can get more information from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/wiki/RatproxyDoc">http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/wiki/RatproxyDoc</a>  This is also a wonderful tutorial <a href="http://isisblogs.poly.edu/2008/07/05/ratproxy-151-tutorial/%C2%A0">http://isisblogs.poly.edu/2008/07/05/ratproxy-151-tutorial/%C2%A0</a> . Don&rsquo;t forget to check it out .  Updated : After playing with ratproxy , I came across other solutions too . Many of them are open-source and the list is  <a href="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/">http://w3af.sourceforge.net/</a>  <a href="http://cirt.net/nikto2">http://cirt.net/nikto2</a>  <a href="http://dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/">http://dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/</a>  <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">http://www.metasploit.com/</a></p>

When I started learning a MVC framework like Zend ( version 1.8 ) with out any prior knowledge in an MVC architectured framework , it was hard for me to figure out many of the things documented in framework.zend.com . I spend lot of time to figure out what they have shown in the examples to <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">develop a simple application which I later published to help people</a> learning zend framework ( Though it was not developed thinking in my mind to publish, I hope it helped some ) . But looking today the zend framework documentation has lots of improvements, may be because I learned something looking other frameworks too. I was interested to see much of the things what symfony does in the command line ( for I love my GNU/Linux terminal and love to work on it ). But after sometime I came to know many of the things that symfony does is with doctrine ORM ( There are lots of other commands too for symfony ) . Doctrine2 will be integrating with zend framework version 2 onwards .  Sometimes I have even blamed zend framework , for I was angry unable to do what I needed spending hours of searching . But I am sorry for that zend. You may ask me why you didn&rsquo;t get into irc or mailing list and ask your doubts . Ya I entered to irc for the first time when I started learning #zf , but its hard to get a quick reply. I saw many people asking questions , but many were not answered . I know the reasons for they will be working on their on projects and getting a quick reply was hard.  Ok let&rsquo;s move on to my topic, I am planning to learn/ sharpen my knowledge in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend framework</a> . I would you to suggest me some topics , that you love to see implemented with zend framework in my spare time. I will be trying to use <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine ORM</a>. I would love to develop it with TDD using <a href="http://www.phpunit.de">phpunit</a> ( Every thing is new just having some knowledge which is harmful <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). If you have anything in your mind let me know .  Thanks for reading my unwanted thoughts .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a web-developer or having some exposure to computers will be knowing which one is the worlds most trusted secure browser .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4561079656/" title="chrome by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/4561079656_6a58fe4f79.jpg" alt="chrome" /></a>  Today I saw an advertisement when I was looking in.msn.com in google chrome, mozilla firefox etc . Seems funny and its really funny that their site scrolls up and never ends in their own browser ie8 which claims as the most secure browser. Oh sorry it never says its the most wonderful browser that renders properly :P , just says its the secure browser , but do you remember why google closed their china office? Great secure browser <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4560434483/" title="ie8 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/4560434483_1b62d7e4f6.jpg" alt="ie8" /></a>  You can see from the above picture how IE 8 is rendering when you scroll down . I don&rsquo;t think , at any point the scrolling ends <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Microsoft please fix that , I love to see it fixed . As its an advertisement they can show its the most secure browser , but how many of you will trust it ? Open-source browser&rsquo;s rocks and Firefox super rocks . Many seems interested in chrome too for the wonderful look and feel ( Chrome is free ) which was modified from the chromium open-source project hosted by google. Web is going with open-standards and please don&rsquo;t stop it moving forward with any more browser like IE6 . I heard IE 9 is pretty good, and have seen the site with the report and nice to see that you are much infront . But I am not sure whether all are correct too :) . Let&rsquo;s make the web as an operating system independet , cross browser compatible . Good luck guys to all in w3c .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have used google chrome , you may have loved its simple menu, navigation etc. I love to make firefox somthing similar to google chrome .  Some firefox addons is necessary to change mozilla firefox look somthing similar to google chrome .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532378436/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4532378436_76b73c6a55.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Addons Needed  1 ) We need to hide the menu, so you can download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762</a>  2 ) Download Personnas , so you can dress mozilla firefox in different looks . You can get it from <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/">http://www.getpersonas.com/</a>  After downloading and installing addons, you need to restart firefox .  Steps involved  1 ) Tick only the navigation toolbar , ie Goto Views &ndash;> Toolbars &ndash;> Click on Navigation Toolbar ( If the menu is not showing you can use Alt + F , Alt + T, Alt + v , will make you jump to Views menu or use your favourite short cut keys )  2 ) Customize your navigation tool bar . ie Goto Views &ndash;> Toolbars &ndash;> Customize  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532380282/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4532380282_435c3ee8c2.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Here you can drag and dropthe things from the navigation . ie where we type the url and all . The left side buttons are draggable and dropped the other window . Try draggind and dropping  .  3 ) Enable Groovy Blue theme for the personnas ( for the bueish look ) or you can create a small image of the same colour of google chrome navigation  and dress your browser, creating new personnas :).  So the final look will be something like the one I showed at the top. Hope you like it :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This Saturday April 10th 2010 , two big events are going to happen in Kerala . If you were following me in twitter you may have noticed it . 1 ) Google Technology User&rsquo;s Group and 2 ) The Adobe Users Group launch event .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497299898/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4497299898_9872bb6922.jpg" alt="Google Technology Users Group Launch Event at Technopark" /></a>  I am Happy that kerala is also getting some user groups . Previously Bangalore was the hub and now we can see small groups peeping here and there all over kerala. The GTUG event venue is UST Global6th Floor (Zentith Hall) ,Bhavani,Technopark , Trivandrum. Timing is between 10 AM to 1 PM .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497302818/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4497302818_ffcec8241d.jpg" alt="Adobe Kerla Users Group Launch Event at Cochin" /></a>  Adobe Users Group Launch event is at Woods Manor Hotel , Cochin. I loved to attend both the events , but both on the same day at different locations . Though I am at cochin I will be moving to technopark , Trivandrum for the GTUG launch event. If you was following me , you may have seen my tweet some days back. I am little late to post in my blog due to certain reasons. The seats for both the events are limited and for the GTUG I think its almost finished . I am not sure about the Adobe event . So you guys can look both the events and can be part of your loving group . You can get more details about Adobe Users Group from <a href="http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/">http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/</a> and the Kerala Google Technology Users group from <a href="http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/">http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mar Athanasios College For Advanced Studies ( MACFAST ) hosted the eighth Barcamp of Kerala.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4470034917/" title="mar athanasios college for advanced studies by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4470034917_023d0cc7af.jpg" alt="mar-athanasios-college-for-advanced-studies" /></a>  It may be the one of the only college which runs a radio. Got pictures from@deepakp7 and @arunbasillal . The college was the sponsor of BCK8 and he offered us to be there at any time we want. We are really Thankful for the Management and the Principal Father Abraham Mulamootil.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4469923633/" title="campus-radio-macfast by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4469923633_53e3c445fe.jpg" alt="campus-radio-macfast" /></a>  Entrepreneurship by Adv. Ivin Gancius was the one I loved, though the presentation was not so colourful. He answered many of the questions raised by the attendees. The other one was Statistical Machine Translation by @deepakp7. He demonstrated how the translations are working and all with some examples. This time @shwetank( The evangelist of opera ) disappointed me. The session registered was The HTML5 Bandwagon and he went with Mobile Web. I was expecting something similar to the awesome presentation made by him at BCK5, Technopark Trivandrum.  Y Perl? by Alan Haggai Alavi was also an interesting one. He was interested to show more stuffs related to Perl if any of us are willing to learn. There was other sessions like Spara &ndash; Energy Conservation Product by Deepa Eswar. You may be knowing her, she was one of the anchor at Kairali TV ( The Malayalam Communications Limited ) , Web Penetration in Kerala &ndash; Status Report &amp; Forecast by Aravind Jose, No Negative Day etc was some other sessions. Niju Mohan presented his experience on Tata Jagriti Yatra. Ajith Sam John a BTech student speaks about Social Media Recruitment. Its interesting to see he too recuits people to do work :). Kenny Jacob is going to getting married soon. May be the reason he came with Cultural Invasion Vs Social Evolution. Arun Basil Lal went with a session WordPress-ing It. He started with installation of wordpress, plugins, themes etc. Though these were the stuffs we do often, but there are people who don&rsquo;t know how to install it. I think it was very useful for those people and hope they will explore wordpress. Its really nice to see Engineering Students active in Barcamps. The last session was by Binny V A launching the product  eNGO.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4484449720/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4484449720_a15ea94ddb.jpg" alt="8th Barcamp Kerala at MACFAST" /></a>  A snapshot from BCK8 . Photo credits to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/aravindjose/BCK8">Aravind Jose</a>  The lunch and evenining tea was provided by the college. The food was so delicious. We all enjoyed the lunch and tea made some conversations with the Principal Father Abraham Mulamootil. He was also an active attendee and its nice to see such a college and Principal. The college provide internet facility 24 X 7 for the students. When I was at CUIET doing my BTech ( 2003-2007 ), our lab was not open 24 X 7 or we was not having full time internet facility. But its really nice to see colleges like MACFAST and a good principal who motivates his students. Motivation is a key factor that makes a professional. If it lags then its something like schooling than doing BTech as a professional Degree . So the campus needs such colleges, lectures , pricipals to make a better next generation. So bye for now hoping to see you for the next Barcamp 9.</p>
