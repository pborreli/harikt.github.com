  <div class="entry-content"><p>May be you already know Aura Project for PHP recently moved to 5.4. So I want to download PHP 5.4 and compiled. You need to download the development library files if you are seeing any errors. Just do via synaptic or apt-get. I did download apache2 and installed. Its not that much hard .  You can also run the tests, and report the errors to QA, which will help us. But I was facing a problem. Normally the php cli will be in /usr/bin/php . But in our case , it will be in /usr/local/bin/php . I was getting error when trying to execute phpunit and many pear packages. So the way you can do is to symbolic link /usr/bin/php to /usr/local/bin/php .  If you want to run <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/multiple-php-version-setup.html">multiple PHP versions of PHP like PHP 5.3 , 5.4</a> etc consider reading <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a> post and use the script to do the work. A big Thanks to him for sharing it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&rsquo;s Aura project ? :  For those who are new to Aura , <a href="http://auraphp.github.com">Aura project</a> was a component based library planned for 5.3+, which is a major rewrite of <a href="http://solarphp.com">Solar framework for PHP</a>. As PHP 5.4 RC4 has already released and within a few weeks we expect 5.4 having a stable release. So today in the eve of New Year, Paul M Jones the lead developer for Aura Project for PHP officially announced Aura will be targetting for PHP 5.4 + and not for 5.3.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 11th BarCamp Kerala to be conducted on 20th Nov 2011 is IIM( K ) campus at Calicut. I have been thinking to speak on BCK for a long. But this time I thought of going for a try.  The session is on Social media and Business  Not a huge talk , but a small one. Remember I am not a Business man, nor marketing manager and is interested to talk on integrating facebook with PHP on your website, or on PHP 5.3. But this will go more specifically for a PHP Developer and I don&rsquo;t know the level and enthusiasm of the audience.  So this talk is to make you think how you can utilize social media from the eyes of a developer. I loved to make the session to be an interactive one. And I guess the IIM guys, marketing guys, entrepreneurs all can give some input for this talk. If anyone is interested I will show some codes and demonstrate how easy its to integrate Facebook on your website and make you think how to make business out of it.  The slides I prepared to talk on the event is below .  <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/harikt/iim-10274824" title="Speaking at Barcamp Kerala 11th Edition at IIM(K)">Speaking at Barcamp Kerala 11th Edition at IIM(K)</a></strong> View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/harikt">Hari K T</a> As I reached IIM, I didn&rsquo;t see that much people who are in Managers, but most of them was having a technical background. So switched my topic, how you can integrate Facebook on ypur Website. But the slides of that is not here, for it will be soon available as an article in <a href="http://phpmaster.com">phpmaster.com</a>. When I was writing the article I made a playground with Aura Autoloader , oEmbed, Zend_Http_Client, FB-SDK etc . See it in action at <a href="http://harikt.com/fbgapi">harikt.com/fbgapi</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a serious one , that you should never miss this Barcamp Kerala 11 th edition ( #BCK ) .  Opera evangelist Shwetank Dixit is with his talk HTML5 and beyond  I still remember his talk in 5th BCK, my first Barcamp, which was one of the reasons I got addicted to Barcamps. Yes there was lots of others too, but talk by evangelist is something different. You will recognize only if you have ever heard. I am really happy to see his talk in the <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">Barcamp sessions list</a>  Remember the next age is HTML5 , so dive into HTML5. Yes we can start developing HTML5 websites which old IE can also make use of it. Ask your developer to start learning about the modernizer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv">HTML5 Shiv</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was introduced to the world of Internet after my 10th standard examination. Was not having a computer at home, so just browse a few hours a month or around 6 month time. But later when I got my first AMD Athlon ( When I am doing my BTech in IT) , I got a start-up pack. From there onwards I am addicted to computers and internet. I hope its not me now , but the whole world is addicted either with social media websites or something like me :) . So we need a good internet provider. I do have a BSNL landline 500 C plan, which I use less as I move from Cochin , Trivandrum, Bangalore , Chennai etc . I have been using BSNL EVDO which offers a 2Mbps connection ( I bought the device for 4500 :P ) . When I was taking the connection was better, but later I feel due to the introduction of BSNL 3G the poor connectivity and resolving issues was high. The customer service is a hell and I was trying to switch to a 3G connection for I want to buy the device only once or I can use my Samsung Galaxy Android set ;) . Looking for a 3G provider in my locality I came to know that the only one currently is BSNL . Aaah hell , the first thing came to me :) . Today I went to buy a SIM to try different 2G and 3G speeds. The first one I tried currently is Vodafone. I was offered the system to have a look into the demo. Great , and I did some testing Tested Vodafone in Calicut : 1 ) Going for google.com :) . 2 ) speedtest.net 3 ) Opening 2 terminals Start &ndash;> Run &ndash;> CMD {syntaxhighlighter BASH} ping -t google.com tracert google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} I am big fan of *nix systems . But the one which is provided for demo is Windows ie why the commands :) . For people who want to try in *nix From terminal {syntaxhighlighter BASH} $ traceroute google.com $ ping google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} Why I put a ping -t is for continous ping for windows. Else it will stop after 4 pings . Speedtest for vodafone 3G was impressive . I don&rsquo;t remember the exact time , but download was around 2 Mps I guess and Upload of .11 Mbps ( Sorry if it was wrong ) But tracert and ping was taking more time :( . Anyway I thought of buying a SIM and go for a test from my home. Got one , charged for 2G plan , connected :D . Oh horrible . Changed DNS from googles, 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 and open-dns 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 . Oh my hm . But the one of the most impressive thing is just on a tweet they are ready to know and help. That&rsquo;s a caring customer service . Hands of to that , that&rsquo;s impressive . So I am searching for a good internet provider, and you may already have seen lots of posts on the blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> . But writing this post here is I have more visitors to this website than the other and if you are not subscribed to the other one I will never get an answer for my Question. Please do the ping and tracert commands from Windows . Ctrl + C to exit ping , let it take ping for 10-20 minutes . Please share the screen shots some where and comment on the post with the links . Lets find the best provider which can server internet . I am not looking for Reliance connect , Tata Photon like services for I want to buy the device and also its not available in Kunnamangalam also its a lock as I suffer now with the EVDO 4500 gone :) . So you can check in 2G mode or in 3G do let me know . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mercury Editor : So going through the Symfony CMF post on <a href="http://liip.ch">Liip Blog</a> I came accross a nice editor Mercury. Mercury is a full featured HTML5 editor like Aloha Editor . You can download or see it in action over : <a href="http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/">http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/</a> I am impressed on the first look, awesome :) . Fluid Baseline : Another project I was impressed is the <a href="http://fluidbaselinegrid.com/">Fluid Baseline grid</a> . It may be good that you go and look in browser with different sizes. Some properties are Fluid Columns, Baseline Grid, Responsive Design. Go and see dude :) . Impressive .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working for awhile, and as a developer these are the things that I think will boost the productivity especially if its a start-up. These are some of my thoughts there may be more things to add ( missed once ), or I may add later when I experience those, so on the future if I am starting a startup, that will help me :) . 1 ) Project Management Tool : The one the first thing we need is a project management tool. I am in favour of redmine.org, though its on Ruby on Rails. Hard for a PHP Developer to setup first. But it has lots of features. As I am a PHP Developer , I loved if I can make a port of it . Writing a project management tool is one of my dream. You can view source, see commits , create issues, dead lines, activity oh my awesome . No words simply awesome. 2 ) Operating System : A flavour of Debain. Probably Ubuntu ;) . If yours is a start-up, then moving behind a properitery software like Windows or MAC will eat your money. Not just money, the productivity decreases a lot. I have experience working on Windows and GNU/Linux OS. The Windows-7 eats up a lot of memory . No I am not blaming Microsoft , don&rsquo;t think like that. But when it comes to performance and productivity its easier to work on command lines. A good example is mysql import of a database , export of a database . Deploying to production etc. So the developer will be more familiar than seeing it for the first time. As a developer, never go for a designing level tool like Dreamweaver to code your PHP. I don&rsquo;t have any issues, but it will be hard to move once you are used to it . May be you will introduce the term user friendliness :D . I remember Richard Stallmann saying about it :) on an event in Calicut. Go for Netbeans, Eclipse PDT or Zend Studio or your loved once ( After its upto you who uses it ;) ). A good choice is let your developer move on to use his favourite distro and setup it . Just give the necessary hardware :) . 3 ) Version Control System : Of-course a VCS is necessary . I usually go for git, until I heard an interesting speech about Subversion 1.7 and the future features by Senthil Kumaran S. Yes he made it more clear where to go for SVN and GIT. If you have collobaration with other companies and only some parts need to be gone out, go for SVN. The problem with git is all will be having the working tree . ( Correct me if I am wrong ) . Tracking the commits is easy and we can monitor the activity in redmine &hellip; Wow isn&rsquo;t ? 4 ) Clients : Without Clients , we don&rsquo;t need all these tools , so yes clients play a good role. To make a client/ customer happy is the goal of the organization. Organization means from top to bottom. There will be always communication issues when you work from different places . Yes after all we are humans, ego , anger so and so .. Client has ideas , but developer need to execute to the awesomeness. How can we make it ? When I learned about Software Engineering on my 5th semester B.Tech it was the horrible subject I have ever seen. Lots of theories, and sometimes I even never understood where I want this . Yes those olden days :) . Yes so software life cycles play a good role in the process. But we should build the process, and not just follow some process vaguely . You must be aware what we are going to deliver etc . So a good thing is create a mock up . Yes lots of open-source tools available one I like to mention is a Firefox addon Pencil . You can grab it over <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn/">http://pencil.evolus.vn/</a> . So wireframed :D. Now you know the steps fields and everything . Execute . Split into small tasks, create a dead line for each task. Yes I know its hard to do, eats so much time , but this always brings a good product . Suggestions and improvements will make a good product. Go with the trends than the old ones . For eg : Still developing with old 5.2 frameworks when we have the awesome 5.3 Framework ? 5 ) Database : The most horrible one I have ever seen is migrating database from development to production. Yes I know you may tell about Doctrine Migrations, Db Deply etc <a href="http://dbdeploy.com/">http://dbdeploy.com/</a> . If you are the administrator of the server and is able to install softwares , then don&rsquo;t hesitate to switch from DBMS to Mongo or Couch if its suitable . There will always occur a time to port from one to the other . Go for utf-8 collation, if its international , InnoDb for relationships, MyISAM for fast text search so and so . Know what you need, DB is the foundation , so once you laid , its always good that there is no changes needed, or atleast least . Don&rsquo;t forget to choose the right type for the field. I have seen people adding VARCHAR instead of DATE even the type is supported . What to tell Fuck ! . 6 ) Frameworks : Ofcourse not the last , but frameworks helps us a lot . If you start maintaining a website you will really understand the pitfalls. I learned many things looking over the code. There is always good and bad done by others. Looking closely and learn the good and improving the bad help you a lot. For eg : Lets assume a newbie coming and starting a sample blog, if he is using a framework , it may be automatically adding the necessary things to protect CSRF attacks, sometimes validations stuffs etc . This helps a lot even he is not aware what CSRF is. Modelling is hard, love active record implementation .. But :) . 7 ) Good Developers : Good to have self motivated developers. Go from Juniors to Seniors . This will increase productivity a lot. If you have ever wondered how productivity increases , then I can show its easy. Juniors can work on the edit / update / delete / view the borring functionality developer needs to do. There by learning good things for a Junior . Seniors can concentrate on API design or any other logic implementations . 8 ) Unit Testing : There is a huge advantage for unit tests. According to my knowledge there is 1% of the companies write unit tests . Unit testing is always a great boom if it needs to be maintained. I know I have been blamed even I wrote a tutorial on Zend Framework. But I am happy for that , for I looked or started learning from it. You know what breaks , and where it breaks , awesome !! .Always push your developer to write unit test, never go without it :D . 9 ) API and Documentation : Always good to have the methods and classes well documented , there should never arise a confusion why I wrote it . 10 ) Work Space and Atmosphere : i ) A good atmosphere and calm place always brings creativity . I remember the post on Joel on Software . Yes awesome one, love the way . ii ) 5 day work and Flexibility : We all are humans , working for 6 days on a tight schedule will loose our creativity and innovation. So its always good to go for 5 day working company. Peace of mind will bring more productivity and innovations. About the flexibility , some people will love to work on nights , but some on days, some may want to go in the middle. If the tasks are being split and there is no dependency for other people , then flexibility is a good option else mmmm it sucks. Yes I know all these eat up time , but for a better maintainable software time it needed :) . Lets not use and throw the product, like use and throw. Don&rsquo;t forget to contribute back to the open-source tools you use, either by code or $ . You earn from it , let those who develop it also make a living , be human. Note : Please add in your comments if I missed anything , I can add to this . Thanks</p>
