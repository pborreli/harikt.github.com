  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started my career with PHP I have been hearing about PEAR and Symfony a lot. <a href="http://joseantony.com/">Jose Antony</a> was the person who introduced the names <a href="http://symfony-project.org">Symfony</a>, <a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a>, <a href="http://propelorm.org">Propel</a> etc. But at work I never got a chance to touch on those. But my thirst to learn and explore moved me from Cochin to Bangalore and different websites. I played with Symfony in my free time ( Jobeet ). symfony-project was having good articles and videos to move with. I was working for a client who was interested in <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> and asked me to go for a try. It was a hard time in 2009 for me that, the documentation was poor ( from a point of me ) and there wasn&rsquo;t a proper structure for people doing Zend Framework before the introduction of ZF tool in 1.8 ( I guess ) . The way it works and I wasn&rsquo;t either familiar with irc or how I can get some help. Yes it was mainly not the Zend Framework or the community issues. It was my problems to understand from where I can get help. There wasn&rsquo;t a good source to ask how I can use irc or get more information other than search internet. I really struggled with Zend Framework. Google was the only help which can find blog posts on errors and implementation. Some will work, some will not. I still remember the autoload error thrown which mentioned about this will be deprecated in Zend Framework 2 ( IIRC ). lol I wasn&rsquo;t either able to understand looking at those errors. I was having a thought that frameworks cannot be developed by people like me :) . Why I thought so was I was hearing about design patterns a lot and I never properly understood what the hell it was. I failed to find a good mentor. I wrote some blog posts on <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">zend framework</a> to help people who start with it. I wasn&rsquo;t either sure whether I was doing the right things. When I published the post, I did submitted a small intro to <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> with a note to verify whether I was doing it right. But the editor was busy that he mentioned its not possible to check. But some how it was published in <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> . I looked for the person who submitted the article and found it was <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt</a>. I never know about him earlier, but later understood he was the person behind <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> itself :) . In the mean time I did made some changes to the brief information at <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> and submitted it. The article brought lots of visitors and my 1 GB bandwidth got exceed for the 1st time in my life. My friend <a href="http://prajizworld.com">Prajith</a> who was in charge of the server quickly increased the limit when he got my call. This article brought me some opportunity to work with <a href="http://packtpub.com">Packt publishers</a>. Around 2009 or 2010 I came to know about a project called <a href="http://li3.me">lithium</a> via a podcast. I was interested to learn how the frameworks are build. It was using the awesome PHP 5.3 , so I thought of looking into it. At osidays <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcoallier">David Coallier</a> gave an awesome talk on PHP 5.3 . I was able to meet <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org">Fabien Potencier</a> and get an autograph signed. I did meet some awesome PHP gurus at osidays. I started to look more closely into lithium which was in development. I wasn&rsquo;t able to help for I was not that much strong on the concepts. They were using their own git server hosted at <a href="http://dev.li3.me">dev.li3.me</a> . I was not comfortable with <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>, but when we search for git related help, it will be from <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> docs. So I asked about switching the lithium to github for the leaders were having their own reasons to host it there. As I told I was starting with git, I pushed to master in my fork which I wasn&rsquo;t either sure how I can send Pull Request . Again not the problem with the leaders. <a href="https://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/gwoo">Gwoo</a> etc helped me a lot when I got stuck with cloning the repo and errors. I learned some of the git commands, PHP 5.3 etc. I tried to help with testing the mysql stuffs which was done by <a href="https://github.com/Howard3">Howard</a>. Though I tried to contribute stuffs it didn&rsquo;t happened for I failed to understand the process completely. I also looked closely <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a>, but was a bit hard for me. In the early 2011 I got introduced to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for php</a> via the blog post of <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a>. I have earlier looked <a href="http://solarphp.com">SolarPHP</a> , so he was a familiar face. I started to play with it. I also understood the design principles were clearly <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp">mailed in the group</a>, so I found the real mentor whom I was searching. IIRC I forked the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com">auraphp.github.com</a> and made some changes to the style from that of <a href="http://friendsofsymfony.github.com">friendsofsymfony.github.com</a> , and probably that was my first commit to an opensource project . I started to talk on irc and give some patches and bug reports and slowly I became a member of the organization <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> . I know my earlier commits were not going on the right way( I mean the git workflow ), but Paul did merged than closing it or gave suggestions what to do and why you should not go that way etc. He do gave credits for the bugs or suggestions we share in group. Yes it was real joy for people when your commits to an open-source is merged and when you get credits for the work you do. I have noticed people who do just close the PR for there was some error the way the PR is given or if its not the way its expected. I encourage leaders to at-least correct the mistakes than closing the PR with another commit which is already waiting for merge. People who come to open-source are interested to share and learn, not just download the code and use what you are building. They loved to hear why you choose the particular design pattern than blindly using with it, at-least me love it. Note : There is no hatred to any of the projects or leaders. Every one has tried to help me learn various stuffs. It was my failures, to understand it. I fear sometimes the way we think to express may not be read between words. That is the main reason I have kept this note. I know I have not covered everyone and many of the stuffs have been missed. But its not intentionally . But I would like to Thank all for the various helps you have provided via irc, twitter, facebook, mails etc. I did had a great time learning new stuffs. Thanks once again, lets share and learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Note : First I thought of creating an issue, and it was not in github. These are not serious issues, but just my thoughts when installing ZF2 via composer. I am not sure whether its composer related or the way the zf2 is packaged to do it via composer. Normally the composer.json will be something like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zend-form&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies &ndash; Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 25%^C hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ^C {/syntaxhighlighter} But you can see the composer tries to install the whole zend-framework. The problem is you need to add some more lines for its hosted in packages.framework.com and not in packagist.org . So your composer.json will be as below . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zend-form&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies &ndash; Installing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% zendframework/zend-form suggests installing zendframework/zendservice-recaptcha (ZendService\ReCaptcha component) Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} Great you installed the zf2 form component. Now you can see where the form is installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ Annotation FieldsetInterface.php composer.json Fieldset.php Element FieldsetPrepareAwareInterface.php ElementInterface.php FormFactoryAwareInterface.php Element.php FormInterface.php ElementPrepareAwareInterface.php Form.php Exception TODO.md Factory.php View {/syntaxhighlighter} Assume you have more zf2 packages which you have added. At a later point you think of installing the framework as a whole itself than adding more packages in the composer.json . So your composer.json will be some what like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zendframework&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar update Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies &ndash; Removing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) &ndash; Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} The form has been removed and framework is installed. Lets have a look where its installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zendframework&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ bin INSTALL.md README-DEV.md resources composer.json library README-GIT.md tests demos LICENSE.txt README.md vendor hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/Zend/ Authentication Di InputFilter Mvc Stdlib Barcode Dom Json Navigation Tag Cache Escaper Ldap Paginator Text Captcha EventManager Loader Permissions Uri Code Feed Log ProgressBar Validator Config File Mail Serializer Version Console Filter Math Server View Crypt Form Memory ServiceManager XmlRpc Db Http Mime Session Debug I18n ModuleManager Soap {/syntaxhighlighter} You can notice its going on the wrong place. vendor/zendframework/zend-form . I am not sure whether every one needs to remove all the installed packages to install the framework . It seems possible with naming zendframework/package . Thus it don&rsquo;t remove the installed packages. May be there are some other issues related to it for the naming of zendframework/zend-form like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I got a chance to be at Bangalore for Open Hack India 2012 conducted by Yahoo.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrowan/7751044880/" title="IMG_5052 by mrowan, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8286/7751044880_e0cb1fea0b.jpg" alt="IMG_5052" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrowan/7751030446/" title="IMG_5065 by mrowan, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8296/7751030446_54abd3bc44.jpg" alt="IMG_5065" /></a>  It was really a great time to learn and do some of the experiments on Yahoo developer network (ydn) tools.  So we ended up trying to do some stuff with <a href="http://open.dapper.net/">dapper</a>. Dapper is a tool used for scrapping. It seems interesting from the workshop. But when I started using it, I was not successful. The dapper stopped responding / showing updating preview and stuffs.  What I was trying todo?&lt; /p>  I used to buy books comparing prices from isbn.net.in . It helped me a lot in buying books very cheap in India. But isbn.net.in was not having a feature called search for book title, and isbn details and as it does currently. Yes there were various other services that do the same. But if you think so then you must think why gmail was developed for there were yahoo mail, aol, msn etc were there.  So anyway learning was the idea, but as dapper fails to respond, it seems hard. I tried to contact the developers via the contact form. But I didn&rsquo;t got a reply on Hack days to further proceed on it. So I tried various other methods via Yahoo pipes, yql etc.  It was really nice to learn and make my hands dirty with yql. I tried different stuffs. Exploring it I found the url shortner from Yahoo.  So once I reached home I made a url shortner which is currently in github ( <a href="http://harikt.github.com/openhackindia/">http://harikt.github.com/openhackindia/</a> ) . Its simple with a few lines.  {syntaxhighlighter class=&ldquo;html&rdquo;} {/syntaxhighlighter} YQL is powerful, try and play. Its awesome guys.  I also came to know about Boomerang from Yahoo.  I was planning to buy a Bean Bag, and yes I got as a present from Yahoo.  Thank you guys for the awesome event. I am really sad for not able to submit a Hack :( . But I will explore more the ydn resoucres in future. Hope to see you next time if everything permits.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I reached so early that <a href="http://www.acodersdream.com/2012/07/walking-through-nimhans.html">I walked through the NIMHANS compound.</a>   The first talk was   1 ) Your GNOME on the cloud: Big data challenges in Personalized Medicine by Ramesh Hariharan :   My interest to medical field is too less that I am here into the field of IT. So I didn&rsquo;t concentrate that much to the talk. I understood they are facing more problems than in Big data itself.     2 ) Building Watson : A breif overview of DeepQA and the Jeopardy! Challenge by Karthik Visweswariah :   The talk was some of the challenges facing in the terms used in search like &ldquo;see&rdquo; and &ldquo;saw&rdquo; and much more than that. The talk was interesting to know about the problems faced. Some of the audience expressed the talk was too good that it dived into the problems they really face in search. They also mentioned some people who search for malayalam words in english is too hard to understand what they are really searching.   We have some time for tea and networking. Discussed with friends whom I met in Hacknight in which room they are going etc.   3 ) Exponential Growth Models and Impact on Sales Forecast, Data Volume, Query Latency, Capacity, Planning and Search Latency by Ashok Banerjee   He started with the slide Fungus on White Bread. The talk was so interesting that he mentioned lots of stuffs that can impact on business. As he was from flipkart he has some real world examples also. He mentioned how the growth of certain products like books can go up where as certain products like under wear or tissue which can be used to wipe, when your eyes are wet will not. He also mentioned how it can bring new customers from the friends circle. Lately I came to know more about Ashok Banerjee from Mohith that he previously  worked with google and twitter. I feel this is the most interesting talk of the day.     4 ) The Elephant that flew: Big data analytics @ Inmobi by Gaurav Agarwal :   Though I loved to sit for the Aadhaar &ndash; worlds largest biometric identity platform I went to hear the talk The Elephant that flew. It was mainly for I came to know that in the mobile world there are none other than them. Guarav went through the challenges, the tools they used and the current tools they are using to build it for their customers. He showed a demo on Yoda which can be released open-source, but still they are thinking on how they should open-source it. Its mainly like whether they want to release as small components or as a whole itself.  What is Yoda ? Yoda is nothing but something similar to Hive or Pig. But Yoda according to them is more powerful and flexible. It takes less time to process.   5 ) Messaging architecture at Facebook by Joydeep Sen Sharma :    The talk went something deep into the architecture at facebook. As he was having limited time he was running too fast. The stuffs were somewhat deep, the truth is I wasn&rsquo;t able to understand some of them. According to my friends the talk was interesting as they were delaing / facing it.     6 ) Real time intelligent systems and Big data streams by Deepinder Dhingra :    I didn&rsquo;t find the talk that much interesting, probably for I am not really into the field.   7 ) Recommendation Play at flipkart by Gaurav Bhalotia, Pavan Srinivas, Renuka Khandewal :   The subject was so interesting. But they presented not in that interesting way. I felt they were not prepared well also. As the talk was for only 30 minutes when you have 3 speakers, there is hardly 10 minutes of time a speaker needs to talk. But even that they didn&rsquo;t prepared is a bad thing. Probably they were nervous for may be their first talk? Anyway I feel they can improve, but these are just my thoughts on it.   After tea I skipped the 2 talks and we were talking with wikipedia foundation, the internet archive guys and open data people. The internet archive has a new project called openlibrary.org which has a collection of books. They also have an API which I want/love to explore. We also discussed how they scan old books and how google used to scan books. They mentioned google was using distructive scanning which means they will cut the side where the books are tied and is then run by the system itself. It was nice to learn how these guys scan these much books. I came to know that for internet archive they can scan around 1000 pages per day. We also went to the cis ( centre for internet and society ) stall. I came to know more about the cis.   So wrapping up, the fifth elephant by Hasgeek was good. The event organizers did a good job in making the sessions running on time. When I was at osidays in 2010, what I faced was some sessions will exceed the time given that will create issues with other sessions running in parallel. So the people who love to attend session  in A1 and then loved to move to A2 or A3 will get into trouble. Either they want to skip the last minutes of the talk on one place to join the other or the other session may not have ended there. But this didn&rsquo;t happened once in the fifth elephant.   The organizers also did a good job for the food. We had tea/snacks in morning and evening and lunch in afternoon. I feel 2500 rupees was worth and affordable for a techie. The problem with osidays is they have many passes which costs much more price. And also the sessions sometimes overlaps. The rate of pass if something like 2500 is an affordable one for I want to spend more on lodging also. So the total cost of the event will again go up in my accomodation and travelling. But this time I have submitted my talk for osidays and foss.in. I am looking forward to see what will happen whether I get a chance as a speaker or not :&ndash;) .   I talked with the geeks at flipkart whom I met on Hacknight. Thanks to Vivek Mehta for offering me a flipkart T-shirt. But unfortunately  the size they gave me was small, for they felt its same as that of Medium. But I cannot enter my head through that hole :P . Probably the wrong decision by me not asking again for the Medium. Anyway I will give it to someone as a present, though I wished I could keep it remembering my day on HackNight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>9:30 &ndash; 10:15 : Crunching Big Data, Google Scale by Rahul Kulkarni   I was little bit late, but it was something interesting to know about bigquery.cloud.google.com . I am still trying to figure out how I can make use of these stuffs. Its really a cool thing to hackon.     10:15 &ndash; 11:00 : In Data We Believe Harish Pillay of Red Hat   This talk was also an interesting one to learn and know about glusters. I met some of these guys of glusters at the Redhat stall. Gluster was an open-source tool which was developed by guys at Bangalore and later acquired by Redhat. It was something great to know about it.     11:00 – 11:30 : Tea and chitchat. It was interesting to meet the Hacknight guys Sidharth, Siju, Raison etc.   11:30 – 12:15 : An Introduction to Data Visualization and Processing by Uttam Grandhi   Uttam presented nicely. He was so cool and shared how the Japanese fountain shows the numbers and stuffs in fountain.     He also showed how we can working with Processing a java based tool and how we can visualize without data itself.   12:15 – 1:00 : Visualizing Text by S Anand of Gramener.com   Yes S Anand is so popular among developers. Yes I know him via s-anand.net some years back. But I wan&rsquo;t able to recognize him when he was infront of me at #Hacknight. But this time I didn&rsquo;t missed to say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; to him. He with his collegue presented the talk so awesome. I as a participant feel that was the awesome talk of the day. He presents stuffs in a different way. I liked it. There was a difference in the way he speaks. Yes that makes him different from others. He mentioned about wordle.net, sip.s-anand.net, trendsmap.com, openbible.info, sentimental analysis, circular vizualisation and many more.     1:00 – 2:00 we had an awesome Lunch   2:00 – 2:30 Looking Beyond the Usual Suspects for Near Real-time Analytics on Big Data by Navjot Sidhu of Paypal. When we hear about people who has more problems than what we face, we know ours is not a big problem at all. Navjot Sidhu mentioned paypal having 500 transactions per second, 25 TB data and stuffs like that. I wonder how paypal really scales. It was interesting to know that the core of paypal is C which is almost 75 % of the code. He also talked about the events firing for a single transaction. I remembered about the Aura.Signal for a while.     2:30 – 3:00 : Build Your Own Real-time Analytics and Visualization, Enable Complex Event Processing, Event Patterns and Aggregates by Ramesh Perumalsamy and Vishnu H. Rao of Flipkart.     It was nice to know about logstash, graylog2, elastic search, statsD, graphite etc. I want to explore some of them.   3:00 – 3:30 “I know what you are going to do next summer” – Predicting Repeat Purchase Behavior by using Bayesian Hierarchical model and Regression Techniques Biswajit Pal, Subhasish Mishra and Manav Shroff I expected something, but as the talk goes on I didn&rsquo;t see much importance sitting over there. So left the hall and had a chat with the guys over the stall.   3:30 – 4:00 Oh Tea break :) .   4:00 – 4:30 : Building, Analyzing and Visualizing Large Graphs by Ashwin Rajeev There were lots of people for this talk than the room can accomodate. I was sitting on the floor. The session was interesting to learn more on graphs. He mentioned about rapheljs, d3.js as Uttam mentioned earlier in his talk.   4:30 – 5:00 : Approaches to ML Techniques on Real World Data by Venkata Ramana I was able to understand what he was trying to explain for I was at #Hacknight. But I feel most of them didn&rsquo;t find the talk interesting.   5:00 – 5:30 : Build Your Own Search Engine by Siddhartha Reddy of flipkart.     This was an interesting talk. I learned something interesting. Indexer, Searcher, Text Analysis, Tokenisation, Stop Word Removal, Normalization, Case folding, Synonyms, Others, Stemming, Lemmatization etc.  He also showed Term document matrix, inverted index, ranking, inverse document frequency etc. He suggestested a text titled Introduction to Information Retrieval for further reading   <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/">http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/</a>   And finally winding up day one with 5:30 – 6:15 Panel Discussion: Best Practices by Kalpana Krishnaswami, Prithvijit Roy, Joydeep Sen Sarma, Anand S, Rohit Chattar, Navjot Sidhu Moderated by Govind Kanshi   I don&rsquo;t know how I missed to hear the talk Anand Chitipothu and Noufal Ibrahim &ndash; How the Internet Archive Preserves Petabytes of Data  </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone has been hearing the buzz REST. As web services and api for websites are becoming popular, all are busy developing REST api&rsquo;s for their websites. What exactly is REST? REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed systems such as the World Wide Web. REST has emerged over the past few years as a predominant Web service design model. This is what wiki mentions . The book REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé; O&#8217;Reilly Media will teach you some rules which needs to be followed. This book has really helped me to understand some of the basic concepts of HTTP protocol. Yes really I was able to understand more on REST and how it should be represented etc. Probably you would have noticed websites with format .html , .json , .xml . If you have ever thought its REST, then its not :&ndash;) . Do you know a trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs ? Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs ? There are more rules , but you can read and learn the rest from the book. The book has a total of 94 pages, but will serve you for a good reference. It also introduces WRML (<a href="http://www.wrml.org/">http://www.wrml.org/</a>) . Cons : Yes I feel there are some cons for the book. There are some examples when introducing WRML like the one below . {syntaxhighlighter class=&ldquo;html&rdquo;} application/wrml; format=&ldquo;<a href="http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json">http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json</a>&rdquo;; schema=&ldquo;<a href="http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player">http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player</a>&rdquo; {/syntaxhighlighter} But when you point your browser to <a href="http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json">http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json</a> you will get a 404. Example url : Its always a good way to mention example.com than mentioning <a href="http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player">http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player</a> . There are at many places its happening . You will not get completely on a first read when the chapters are moving, but sometimes you may want to read it many times. But I loved this book for I learned some basic stuffs really and also this is always a reference for future. In a rating of 5 , I will rate 4 . If you are interested in this book, you can buy this from REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé : <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021575.do">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021575.do</a> Pages: 116 Print ISBN:978-1-4493-1050-9 | ISBN 10:1-4493-1050-8</p>
