  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends, Many of you may have heard of google book search. It was active for a past few years. There were some cases registered by the authors, bcoz there was a preview of the book.  Now google has reached on a compromise with authors and the publishers. It was easy for me to read some of the books from google book search . The google book search is now expanding. Many of the books are out of print.  Google is making the necessary things to make it available online. People can buy the books from google. I think Amazon may be the first to hit, if google launch this service. You can read more about the google books from<a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/">http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may have noticed a change in user interface . Yes I have changed my CMS from Joomla to Drupal. I don&rsquo;t want to miss many of the indexed search results of google and any other search engines . So it takes some time to make this site fully functional. I just removed my old site . Keeping a screen shot of it below .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3594102745_681ca97b86.jpg?v=0" alt="harikt.com in joomla once" />  I have <del>missed</del>to add some of the ads here. Also the google custom search. Also I <del>need to implement</del> the fluid width to the new theme like the one of rs_milky. See you soon in a great new look <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> Cheers .  Yes, now I have changed some of the styles. Not getting much time to spend on my site. In the future you can see some more changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have told you , when your disk space is less, you can host your pictures in flickr, picasa or at some other place. I used to upload pictures to picasa , but some times the pictures are not loaded . But flickr is a nice solution .  Now you can edit the pictures uploaded to flickr using picnik tool. Flickr has partnered with picnik. So its easy to edit pictures after uploading to flickr . No need to edit from your system. Just upload it and edit online. It seems to be easy . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" />  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3577983096_44172c4e74.jpg?v=0" title="features available in picnik to those who upgrade it" alt="features available in picnik" /> There are various effects in picnik . You can make a particular place in colored in the picture and the remaining as black and white with Focal B/W . Cool right ? But you need to pay some . These additional features are available only for those who upgrade it.  Some of them are Neon , Snow effect, film grain , posterize etc. You can try it for free . Need to upgrade only if you love to save the picture . So why waiting go and try it man .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is some what interesting post to many of you . I have tried some time to make this correct for one of my friend Jaisenan . I like debugging, so spend some time to make this working. We was looking to get the value in a multidimensional array . One of the value in the array was an object. And this was the big problem , and was looking to solve it . Here is the array  $x = Array ( [#theme] => content_multiple_values [#title] => Face to Face Time [#required] => 0 [#description] => [0] => Array ( [#type] => duration_combo [#default_value] => Duration Object ( [duration] => Array ( [years] => 0 [months] => 0 [days] => 0 [hours] => 0 [minutes] => 0 [seconds] => 0 )  [is_negative] => [is_valid] => 1 [conversion_factors] => Array ( [seconds/minutes] => 60 [minutes/hours] => 60 [hours/days] => 24 [days/weeks] => 7 [days/months] => 30 [weeks/years] => 52.142857142857 [months/years] => 12 )  )  [#largest_metric] => hours [#smallest_metric] => minutes [#element_validate] => Array ( [0] => duration_combo_validate )  [#title] => Face to Face Time [#description] => [#required] => [#weight] => 0 [#delta] => 0 [#columns] => Array ( [0] => iso8601 [1] => approx_seconds )  [#field_name] => field_pn_ff_time_1 [#type_name] => progress_note )  [#field_name] => field_pn_ff_time_1 [#tree] => 1 [#weight] => 4 [#access] => 1 [#count] => 5 )  Let the array name be x . Now let me walk through this associative array in PHP . $x[&lsquo;#theme&rsquo;] , $x[&lsquo;#title&rsquo;] etc . Now we where looking to get the value of hours , minutes etc of the array duration . The &lsquo;#default_value&rsquo; was a Duration object .  So here comes the solution for you .  <strong>$x[0][&lsquo;#default_value&rsquo;]&ndash;>duration[&lsquo;hours&rsquo;]</strong> . You can assign values or get values of this array . I spend some hours to make this small code work. So thought of publishing this for some one who is in search for an example like this . This was a small debugging from Drupal .   $x[&lsquo;#tree&rsquo;] , $x[&lsquo;0&rsquo;][&lsquo;#type&rsquo;] are some other example to retrieve value from this multidimensional array . The example above is used to get the value from the object . Cheers guys and Have a great day .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Integrated Development Environment or IDE in short . I am some what an active user in the php classes group . Recently an editor was the talk . He actually was looking for a debugger , and many people came with different solutions . I have tried Netbeans , Eclipse, Aptana and Zend Studio . Just installed and run some samples that&rsquo;s all what I have an experince with IDE for PHP. These IDE&rsquo;s are used by php developer , download and try. Many PHP IDE&rsquo;s like Netbeans , Eclipse , Aptana etc are free php developer softwares. Some commercial php developer softwares are also available.  But thought of writing some of the editors that I was new.  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" title="Netbeans IDE for PHP">Netbeans</a> : A wonderful opensource IDE from Sun Microsystems . Used for developing Java applications mainly. Now supporting PHP development too . It was really useful when I was developing a Java application for the mini project . Jose Antony was the one who introduced Netbeans and Eclipse before us. It helped us a lot to develop the application some what quickly, even though we were new to it .  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Eclipse IDE for PHP">Eclipse</a> : Another opensource IDE used for Java application development mainly . Now supporting PHP development with additional plugins . Eclipse may be some what popular than Netbeans . You can download PDT which is a stand alone .  <a href="http://www.aptana.com" title="Aptana IDE for PHP">Aptana</a> : This is really new to me . This is one that I have got from the discussions . I was not aware of Aptana , its an opensource IDE by community and also have a commercial one which is based on Eclipse IDE. You can download Aptana as a plugins for Eclipse. Really a wonderful tool for developers . Some of the features that I have not seen in Netbeans , Eclipse etc is the html view as shown in a browser itself. Thats really a cool feature. Aptana will not run in 64 bit edition for now . It can be used as a  plugin for Eclipse if you are using 64bit in GNU/Linux . Some more configurations are needed for running Aptana in Ubuntu .  <a href="http://zend.com">Zend Studio</a> : The IDE for PHP developed by Zend , the one who supports PHP . All can download Zend Studio, a 30 day trial for free from Zend. Its also an eclipse based IDE . Has many features when you are working on Zend framework an open-source framework for PHP, like symfony-project , cake , code ignitter , yii etc .  You can use simple editors too for PHP development, its your choice to select the one which suits you really.  Nusphere : PHPed or Nusphere is a commercial IDE for PHP development like zend studio. I have not tried but many are recommending this. I don&rsquo;t know the importance of this when zend studio is there . Link : <a href="http://www.nusphere.com/">http://www.nusphere.com/</a>  These IDE &rsquo;s are platform independent as they are developed in Java , so will run on Windows , GNU / Linux or Unix operating system . I am using Ubuntu 9.04 and this runs without any problem. You cannot compare these IDE&rsquo;s with dreamweaver. Dreamweaver is built for designers than for programmers . If you are looking for a Dreamweaver like one for GNU/Linux you can go for Quanta plus or Screem . If you are just a designer then you can go for Kompozer , which is similar to dreamweaver ( Don&rsquo;t think its exactly as dreamweaver ).  The use of a PHP IDE is not just syntax highlighting . When you are using a MVC or just a class the methods and properties can be viewed by just ctrl+ space . This is a really helpful feature when you are coding in MVC architecture .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me tell you first of all , this is just what I think, so forgive me if you don&rsquo;t like.  As all of you know it was a long wait for the one month long election process. My constitution was Calicut / Kozhikode . I have casted my vote on 16th of April . The main candidates were Muhammed Riyas and M K Ragavan of Congress. M K Ragavan has won the game with a lead of 838 votes. Let me congragulate him at this moment. Some of the reasons that Muhammed Riyas may have failed to win in the elections may be  1 ) Support for PDP  2 ) In the center Congress or BJP will only come . So why we need to give vote for LDF ? ( To support Congress ?) . We may get some good Ministers if we have good number of candidates.  3 ) CPIM has changed a lot from its previous stand .  4 ) I am not a person who is interested in religion / caste . I am a person who stands to support the poor and not on the basis of caste or religion . But the stand of the LDF have changed . You can see the candidates , which may be a game I think .  5 ) Not supporting Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam. This is a site each and every Indian must see and get inspiration <a href="http://www.abdulkalam.com/" title="Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam">http://www.abdulkalam.com/</a>. Somnath Chatterjee was a great person . CPI(M) expelled him.  6 ) Not making the right decision to change a leader if he is blamed as corrupted . Let the others come forward and if the corruption case is over it can be handed over . Why you need to be so much tensed ?  7 ) Failure of the LDF goverment in Kerala, in the educational sector like Professional Education . Even though they blame the court I don&rsquo;t think its the court that plays the game . Failure to make it clear infront of court is the failure of the goverment . What was the case when the congress was ruling here . I still remember the talks of K K Rakesh who has failed at Kannur . Failure to support the goverment employees who has fought against corruption like Suresh Kumar . Supporting ADB for which the LDF has made a lot of remarks .  Anyway the congress will come in the center . According to the latest news of malayalamanorma the UPA : 258 NDA : 162 Third Front : 066 Others : 057 . The third front is just a dream for now . The CPI( M ) has losts their seats in West Bengal and Kerala . This may be the right time to recognize the people , and what they think for the PB. The LDF only manages to get 4 seats and lost 16 . Lost their sitting seats too . The things I have pointed may not be the reasons , but some of you may agree . In my locality its the worst road I have ever seen. The sitting MLA U C Raman has given 50 Lakhs for the betterment . The panchayath is being ruled by LDF . Failure to repare the roads may also have added support to congress there I think . Like the same in every constituency each and every problems may have made this election a wonderful one.  Let&rsquo;s see the next 5 years of the congress lead government . Have a great day guys .</p>
