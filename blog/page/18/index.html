  <div class="entry-content"><p>All of you may have heard about the google calendars . Its a free service by google. You just need a gmail id .  But I was looking like a one that&rsquo;s freely available. Now adays I got  a chance to work with the javascript frameworks like jquery and prototype. Working on it, I was impressed . Its really cool guys, if you know little javascript then , you can look into it . Yes once you used , you will never go without using one of it . :) .  Yes talking about the week planner . I searched for a jquery based week planner. This is one I got and it looks cute and its having almost all functionalities . I have seen a DHTML calendar , but when resizing the events overlaps. But in this there is no such over laps occuring . There are lots of methods , you can see the demo and know how it works. If you are satisfied then go and look the documentation.  A screenshot is taken to show you how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3671667577_b703d612e6.jpg?v=0" alt="A google like week planner, developed in jquery" />  The demo page is <a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html">http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html</a>  You can visit the site <a href="http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/">http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/</a> , for more informations regarding it .  If you guys have any other stuffs like the one , you can just leave a comment .  Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have updated my Ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04 in the previous month . After the update I was facing a problem when playing videos . When we plays a video the user is being logged out . It was a strange one . I looked the forum , yes many have reported the bug. As I will not be using mainly to view video I thought of not considering the issue much .  But today I was forced to fix for I want to play a movie . What to do with the bug ?  <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . As every one do I go for a google <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/whatchutalkingabout_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Yes I got the solution and its working fine .  These are the things you must do .  Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and add the lines ( You must be root to do this . Eg: From terminal $ sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.lst ) You can use either vim or gedit or your favourite editor . I am using terminal .  deb <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu</a> jaunty main deb-src <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu</a> jaunty main  $ sudo apt-key adv &mdash;recv-keys &mdash;keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79  $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4  Just restart your system . Hope it will work for you too .  For a better understanding of the following please do look the source from where I got the information .  <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889" title="Playing video logs out">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889</a>  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4" title="Fix for the end session playing video in ubuntu">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4</a>  *Do at your own risk . Don&rsquo;t blame me if it doesn&rsquo;t works for you .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By coolris we can use the preview of a website when we search in google. I have tried it and it was a wonderful tool. Recently I found another search engine which uses the same features. But its having something different.  In coolris , when we point to the preview the page will be loaded in small box. May be in an iframe <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  But in searchme each page is loaded with the image of the site. We can move to the next by just moving the mouse to right . Its in beeta version . Looks pretty good .  You can have a look into the site <a href="http://searchme.com">searchme.com</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No one wins at the first time <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Everyone may have faced a failure . A failure is not the end , its just a begining to success . When I was returning from Trivandrum to Ernakulam by train , I met a mother and son. The guy was not feeling good. He was having some sort of stress , strain . Some how I understood he was a +2 student and was afraid of the results and he has lost his sleep and all. So I thought of writing a post about failures. I too have failed at many places . But I will not let the failure rules me .  We should recogise the failure and should learn from it. So a similar failure will not rule you again . When I fails I will not get proper sleep for somedays. I will be thinking about it each day and finally I will get a solution. So guys lost is lost , learn from it , and never fall again into such a situation .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends, Many of you may have heard of google book search. It was active for a past few years. There were some cases registered by the authors, bcoz there was a preview of the book.  Now google has reached on a compromise with authors and the publishers. It was easy for me to read some of the books from google book search . The google book search is now expanding. Many of the books are out of print.  Google is making the necessary things to make it available online. People can buy the books from google. I think Amazon may be the first to hit, if google launch this service. You can read more about the google books from<a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/">http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may have noticed a change in user interface . Yes I have changed my CMS from Joomla to Drupal. I don&rsquo;t want to miss many of the indexed search results of google and any other search engines . So it takes some time to make this site fully functional. I just removed my old site . Keeping a screen shot of it below .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3594102745_681ca97b86.jpg?v=0" alt="harikt.com in joomla once" />  I have <del>missed</del>to add some of the ads here. Also the google custom search. Also I <del>need to implement</del> the fluid width to the new theme like the one of rs_milky. See you soon in a great new look <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> Cheers .  Yes, now I have changed some of the styles. Not getting much time to spend on my site. In the future you can see some more changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have told you , when your disk space is less, you can host your pictures in flickr, picasa or at some other place. I used to upload pictures to picasa , but some times the pictures are not loaded . But flickr is a nice solution .  Now you can edit the pictures uploaded to flickr using picnik tool. Flickr has partnered with picnik. So its easy to edit pictures after uploading to flickr . No need to edit from your system. Just upload it and edit online. It seems to be easy . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" />  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3577983096_44172c4e74.jpg?v=0" title="features available in picnik to those who upgrade it" alt="features available in picnik" /> There are various effects in picnik . You can make a particular place in colored in the picture and the remaining as black and white with Focal B/W . Cool right ? But you need to pay some . These additional features are available only for those who upgrade it.  Some of them are Neon , Snow effect, film grain , posterize etc. You can try it for free . Need to upgrade only if you love to save the picture . So why waiting go and try it man .</p>
