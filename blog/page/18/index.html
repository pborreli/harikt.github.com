  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aptana is an opensource PHP Development IDE . I thought of learning an IDE for development . Habeeb one of my collegue have helped to learn more about Aptana . My system was a 64 bit Intel Core 2 Duo Processor .  I downloaded Aptana Studio stand alone app for Ubuntu 9.04 . I tried to run it , and got an error &ldquo;/home/hari/Aptana Studio/.meta/.log&rdquo; which describes the error report . I opened the .log file but could not trace it out . I searched google and found Aptana is not supporting 64 bit . First I thought it may be the problem because my OS is 64 bit . I downloaded the Aptana Stand alone for Eclipse . And I was having some more trouble configuring it .  Finally I thought of looking whether the Ubuntu 9.04 installed is 32 bit or 64 bit . I tried uname -a . You can also check the forum <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html</a>  $uname -a Linux hari-opensource 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Fri Oct 24 06:42:44 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux  Got the above output . I was able to recognise that mine is a 32 bit version installed ( If you are running a 64 bit Ubuntu you will be getting something like x86_64 in the above line ). Hm then why Aptana doesn&rsquo;t run ?  I looked the link once more <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux">http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux</a> . We need to install xulrunner , although xulrunner 1.9 is installed. Add an additional file call it &ldquo;add&rdquo; or some thing you like and insert the below 2 lines into it .<em> *  </em>export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/xulrunne *  <em>/usr/local/aptana/AptanaStudio</em>  Make the file executable . ie chmod 777 <filename that you have named\> Eg :   $chmod 777 add  $./add  It will work fine for you . Any doubts just leave a comment. Will reply to you soon .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one may have once thought of downloading any video which is played at youtube or dailymotions or any video sites. I have thought of so many times.  This is pretty simple. You don&rsquo;t need a addon or go to another site for it .  For downloading videos and play locally at my system , I am using Mozilla Firefox, and I recommend each and every one to use it . Its the popular opensource browser which is faster than any . Having lots of addons . The only browser that may be supporting HTML 5  <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Sorry Opera too is supporting . Looked IE8 and Google Chrome too from my office . No it doesn&#8217;t  for now , may be in the future . It may not be helpful to users, but great for developers .  So talking about playing a video locally  right <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . First clear the cache of browser ( Tools->Clear Recent History ) . Firefox 3.5 comes with a great improved techniques . You just need to clear cache . You can clear others too if needed . Its not a big deal if you don&rsquo;t clear cache too . I am clearing the cache to quickly see the file I need .  Play the youtube video or what ever video you need to play . After finished playing the video take a new tab ( Ctrl+t ) , type about:cache in the address bar . I have just kept a screenshot .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3684118719_068bbeab2d.jpg?v=0" alt="cache result" />  Copy the cache directory and paste in your favourite explorer . I am using Nautilous , windows guys paste in the explorer . Now you can see lots of files. Arrange them according to file size . Go and play the videos using vlc ( Video Lan Controller ), another opensource player . One of my friend and collegue was behind this post. His name is M S Sujith .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3653/3684140583_f5369b963c.jpg?v=0" alt="Screenshot of playing mozilla firefox cache video" />  You don&rsquo;t need any addon . Have it . Remember to move from cache if you need it permenantly . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello my dear friends ,  I was using GNU/Linux for some 3-4 years now . The one of the browser which comes with every distribution of GNU/Linux is Firefox . Its a wonderful opensource browser available for every Operating Systems . The firefox has a collection of Addons, which makes it much powerful than any other browser .  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/?from=sfx&amp;uid=267461&amp;t=322"><img src="http://images.spreadfirefox.com/affiliates/Buttons/firefox3/foxkeh-fx3-300x250.png" alt="Spread Firefox Affiliate Button" /></a>  I think I was little late to join the community spread firefox . But today I joined the community to spread the fire of the Fox . I have recommended many of my friends for using the nice browser. Once you use you will never go for any other browser . The community is powerful, this may be one of the greatest advantage of firefox . Go and try if you have not downloaded one .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All of you may have heard about the google calendars . Its a free service by google. You just need a gmail id .  But I was looking like a one that&rsquo;s freely available. Now adays I got  a chance to work with the javascript frameworks like jquery and prototype. Working on it, I was impressed . Its really cool guys, if you know little javascript then , you can look into it . Yes once you used , you will never go without using one of it . :) .  Yes talking about the week planner . I searched for a jquery based week planner. This is one I got and it looks cute and its having almost all functionalities . I have seen a DHTML calendar , but when resizing the events overlaps. But in this there is no such over laps occuring . There are lots of methods , you can see the demo and know how it works. If you are satisfied then go and look the documentation.  A screenshot is taken to show you how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3671667577_b703d612e6.jpg?v=0" alt="A google like week planner, developed in jquery" />  The demo page is <a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html">http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html</a>  You can visit the site <a href="http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/">http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/</a> , for more informations regarding it .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have updated my Ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04 in the previous month . After the update I was facing a problem when playing videos . When we plays a video the user is being logged out . It was a strange one . I looked the forum , yes many have reported the bug. As I will not be using mainly to view video I thought of not considering the issue much .  But today I was forced to fix for I want to play a movie . What to do with the bug ?  <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . As every one do I go for a google <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/whatchutalkingabout_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Yes I got the solution and its working fine .  These are the things you must do .  Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and add the lines ( You must be root to do this . Eg: From terminal $ sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.lst ) You can use either vim or gedit or your favourite editor . I am using terminal .  deb <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu</a> jaunty main deb-src <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu</a> jaunty main  $ sudo apt-key adv &mdash;recv-keys &mdash;keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79  $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4  Just restart your system . Hope it will work for you too .  For a better understanding of the following please do look the source from where I got the information .  <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889" title="Playing video logs out">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889</a>  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4" title="Fix for the end session playing video in ubuntu">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4</a>  *Do at your own risk .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By coolris we can use the preview of a website when we search in google. I have tried it and it was a wonderful tool. Recently I found another search engine which uses the same features. But its having something different.  In coolris , when we point to the preview the page will be loaded in small box. May be in an iframe <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  But in searchme each page is loaded with the image of the site. We can move to the next by just moving the mouse to right . Its in beeta version . Looks pretty good .  You can have a look into the site <a href="http://searchme.com">searchme.com</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No one wins at the first time <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Everyone may have faced a failure . A failure is not the end , its just a begining to success . When I was returning from Trivandrum to Ernakulam by train , I met a mother and son. The guy was not feeling good. He was having some sort of stress , strain . Some how I understood he was a +2 student and was afraid of the results and he has lost his sleep and all. So I thought of writing a post about failures. I too have failed at many places . But I will not let the failure rules me .  We should recogise the failure and should learn from it. So a similar failure will not rule you again . When I fails I will not get proper sleep for somedays. I will be thinking about it each day and finally I will get a solution. So guys lost is lost , learn from it , and never fall again into such a situation .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends, Many of you may have heard of google book search. It was active for a past few years. There were some cases registered by the authors, bcoz there was a preview of the book.  Now google has reached on a compromise with authors and the publishers. It was easy for me to read some of the books from google book search . The google book search is now expanding. Many of the books are out of print.  Google is making the necessary things to make it available online. People can buy the books from google. I think Amazon may be the first to hit, if google launch this service. You can read more about the google books from<a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/">http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may have noticed a change in user interface . Yes I have changed my CMS from Joomla to Drupal. I don&rsquo;t want to miss many of the indexed search results of google and any other search engines . So it takes some time to make this site fully functional. I just removed my old site . Keeping a screen shot of it below .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3594102745_681ca97b86.jpg?v=0" alt="harikt.com in joomla once" />  I have <del>missed</del>to add some of the ads here. Also the google custom search. Also I <del>need to implement</del> the fluid width to the new theme like the one of rs_milky. See you soon in a great new look <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> Cheers .  Yes, now I have changed some of the styles. Not getting much time to spend on my site. In the future you can see some more changes.</p>
