  <div class="entry-content"><p>Testing is really pain . How do you figure that all the code you write is fully functional ? For eg : 5 divided by 0 will give you a Math error . So you may need to test our codes . Phpunit is a tool to test your codes . Recently I was trying to learn to write test cases as I started learning Zend framework . There are many automated testing tools like phpunit . You can explore it if needed .  Another one is the phpundercontrol ( I was hearing about this in many blogs and php magazines )  . It can be installed with phpunit . Its also a great tool to see the graphical representation of the php performance . I have not looked much, so do visit the sites and get more informations about it .  <a href="http://www.phpunit.de">http://www.phpunit.de</a>  <a href="http://phpundercontrol.org">http://phpundercontrol.org</a>  <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3858966507_9aef76db9d.jpg" alt="image" />Learning Zend framework made me explore many new tools . The selenium IDE which is an add on for Mozilla is a wonderful tool for testers . For eg : we are humans and we may forget the actions done what all things we do . But we can record our clicks and inputs using selenium IDE . So when an error occurs we can show the developer what happens and what was the input entered etc .  I am really excited to see the Selenium IDE . I hope you testers and developers too will love this wonderful addon . Currently Selenium is supported by the browsers given below .  I have taken the list from the site . So if you are interested please do visit the site and get more information .  Browser Selenium IDE Selenium Remote Control Selenium Core Firefox 3 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests Firefox 2 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests IE 8b1 not supported ? ? IE 7 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 3 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 2 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 9 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 8 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Others not supported Partial support possible* Run tests**</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about Bhuvan recently . I was little busy , but after receiving a mail with subject &ldquo;Bhuvan: ISRO&rsquo;s answer to google earth&rdquo; I thought of looking the site .  This is the address . <a href="http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/">http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/</a> . I saw new news Bhuvan is available in Mozilla firefox and netscape .  Bhuvan is only for the geographical area of India only . But I don&rsquo;t think whether it will gain much popularity if they have not supported or developed a plugin for GNU/Linux or in common *nix systems . I think many of the Indians are now opensource lovers and have moved to *nix platform . So the ISRO which is a goverment body must really support the opensource projects rather than developing something for properitery OS. Now the web is a platform which makes the OS independent . So try to make something which is not an OS dependent software .  I hope they may come with a plugin for *nix systems . I would like to explore Bhuvan after that , and now its not an answer for Google earth . Google earth can be viewed from *nix systems .  This is for ISRO people <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , track your site vistors Operating system and Browser and compare . You can see the difference . Google analytics is a good one or you can go for piwik an opensource web analytics tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning Zendframework . When you are working on some frameworks you need a good IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) . There are many IDE&rsquo;s that are opensource and properitery . I was using Aptana once and then jumped to Eclipse . Recently I got a Zendstudio i5 licence . I was very Happy to see the Zendstudio licence.  If they have not given me a licence I may not be able to buy one too . I don&rsquo;t earn that much money a month lol .  I have loved to buy many videos and studio . But I was unable as I don&rsquo;t have as much penny in my pocket. Anyway I got the Zendstudio-i5 which is a Perpetual license . So I am trying the IDE and will let you know how it looks and what are the things new in it .  Keeping a screenshot of the zendstudio i5 .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2597/3847184227_2dfa1c6eaa.jpg" alt="Zendstudio i5 to make easy development of Zendframework projects" />  Bye and Thanks Zend once again for giving me one copy .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello Guys  Are you new to Zend Framework ? Are you new to MVC ?  Then really you may have thought like me . Where to start and how to start ? Am I right ?  Then this is post is for you my dear friend . I can admit one thing that learning Zend framework is hard though there is a big documentation . There is good examples to the components too . But we will not understand how to bind each other ? Am I right ?  I am also new to Zend Framework . I like the ZF command line most. I looked for many articles , but many was in the old style . Recently I came to a pdf document which was very interesting which is used to administer the site . Every one will look for how to create an admin side using zend frameowork greater than 1.8 . Now its 1.9 too .  I am keeping the pdf which was seen from Slideshare by <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com/">Nick Belhomme</a>. This is a great one for each and every one to start . Hope it may help you . There are many more people who writes about Zendframework in their blog. I recently created a search to search those sites which I think may be helpful to you too . So you can explore it too . The link is <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje">http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje</a>  Good Luck guys . Explore the search engine and grab the Zend Framework .  Bye for now . You can see some from me too in the coming days . lol  Have created the base files need to start your zend framework project . Check it out from <a href="http://harikt.com/content/base-files-start-your-zend-framework-project">http://harikt.com/content/base-files-start-your-zend-framework-project</a> .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying the Zend framework . So these are some of the things that I have learned after the start .  Hope you have installed and configured Zend framework .Please do use some nice IDE&rsquo;s like the Eclipse PDT or Aptana or the Zend Studio . The IDE&rsquo;s are very helpful when you work on projects with zend framework . Please add the include path to Eclipse so it will automatically show the list of methods and members available . Also please do look the coding standards that every one is following especially the Zend .  1 ) Creating a project  # zf create project mysite  *mysite is the name of the project  2 ) Creating a controller  # zf create controller user  * user is the controller . You can use the small letters itself . The command line will add UserController class .  # zf create action login user  * login is the action , user is the controller .  So the code will produce loginAction method in the class UserController .  3 ) You can create a module for admin using  # zf create module admin  4 ) Creating a controller for module  # zf create controller add 1 admin  5 ) Creating an action for add controller in the admin module  # zf create action blog add 1 admin  You can see help also . Just type zf will show you the all available options .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all Happy Independence day . As India is celebrating its Independence I thought of writing a post about Drupal theme that I love . This is my personal opinion . So you can explore the drupal themes section for your selection . After learning more and more about drupal , I started updating this . So I may want to say these are not the 6 , but the different themes that I love . Recently I fall in love with fusion .   <strong>Genesis</strong> : The reason I love it are Flexible layout  : Every design is having a similar layout. I don&rsquo;t think there is not much different layouts . The layout seems to be same . The things that changes are color, images and contents ( lol ).  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3823907806_cd0487d679.jpg" alt="Genesis drupal theme" />  You may never agree with me that this is a good design if and only if you know how to change the style of this theme , like adding some nice graphics etc .  <strong>Zen</strong> : The next wonderful theme that I love is zen for as I described above .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2675/3823926530_3bc27ee92f.jpg" alt="Zen drupal theme" />  <strong>Acquia Marina</strong> : If you are looking the design with out much changes , then this theme Acquia Marina is the one I love . I have made some changes to make it work as a flexible one rather than sticking on to a particular width . I hope IE users also don&rsquo;t have much problem as I am only using GNU/Linux. And I can gaurantee one thing that Mozilla users will not be having any issues .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3823909300_b7ecbd195b.jpg" alt="Acquia drupal theme" />  <strong>Waffles</strong> : Another flexible theme by the same providers of Acquia Marina .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/3823910446_072aed37e5.jpg" alt="Waffle drupal theme" />  <strong>Black Mamba</strong> : Flexible 1, 2, 3 columns like the waffles . May be having some changes to color only .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3823911616_402d0a27d8.jpg" alt="Black Mamba" />  <strong>960 Robots</strong> : From lullabot . Yes they have a video tutorial for building your own themes fr Drupal . They explains the developement of themes from scratch using this theme . The preview is available in youtube . I think buying one will not be a loss of money for any one who is new to Drupal . You can see the podcasts and blog and really will feel it.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3426/3823911904_00e7b5557e.jpg" alt="Nine sixty Robot drupal theme" />     <strong>Fusion</strong> from Top notch themes :  <a href="http://vimeo.com/7670241">Fusion Core Demo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/eternalistic">Jeremy Caldwell</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.  More over every themes are free in the website <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">http://drupal.org/project/Themes</a> . So feel free to explore and try it out .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don&rsquo;t know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .</p>
