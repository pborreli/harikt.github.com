  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about Bhuvan recently . I was little busy , but after receiving a mail with subject &ldquo;Bhuvan: ISRO&rsquo;s answer to google earth&rdquo; I thought of looking the site .  This is the address . <a href="http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/">http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/</a> . I saw new news Bhuvan is available in Mozilla firefox and netscape .  Bhuvan is only for the geographical area of India only . But I don&rsquo;t think whether it will gain much popularity if they have not supported or developed a plugin for GNU/Linux or in common *nix systems . I think many of the Indians are now opensource lovers and have moved to *nix platform . So the ISRO which is a goverment body must really support the opensource projects rather than developing something for properitery OS. Now the web is a platform which makes the OS independent . So try to make something which is not an OS dependent software .  I hope they may come with a plugin for *nix systems . I would like to explore Bhuvan after that , and now its not an answer for Google earth . Google earth can be viewed from *nix systems .  This is for ISRO people <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , track your site vistors Operating system and Browser and compare . You can see the difference . Google analytics is a good one or you can go for piwik an opensource web analytics tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning Zendframework . When you are working on some frameworks you need a good IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) . There are many IDE&rsquo;s that are opensource and properitery . I was using Aptana once and then jumped to Eclipse . Recently I got a Zendstudio i5 licence . I was very Happy to see the Zendstudio licence.  If they have not given me a licence I may not be able to buy one too . I don&rsquo;t earn that much money a month lol .  I have loved to buy many videos and studio . But I was unable as I don&rsquo;t have as much penny in my pocket. Anyway I got the Zendstudio-i5 which is a Perpetual license . So I am trying the IDE and will let you know how it looks and what are the things new in it .  Keeping a screenshot of the zendstudio i5 .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2597/3847184227_2dfa1c6eaa.jpg" alt="Zendstudio i5 to make easy development of Zendframework projects" />  Bye and Thanks Zend once again for giving me one copy .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello Guys  Are you new to Zend Framework ? Are you new to MVC ?  Then really you may have thought like me . Where to start and how to start ? Am I right ?  Then this is post is for you my dear friend . I can admit one thing that learning Zend framework is hard though there is a big documentation . There is good examples to the components too . But we will not understand how to bind each other ? Am I right ?  I am also new to Zend Framework . I like the ZF command line most. I looked for many articles , but many was in the old style . Recently I came to a pdf document which was very interesting which is used to administer the site . Every one will look for how to create an admin side using zend frameowork greater than 1.8 . Now its 1.9 too .  I am keeping the pdf which was seen from Slideshare by <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com/">Nick Belhomme</a>. This is a great one for each and every one to start . Hope it may help you . There are many more people who writes about Zendframework in their blog. I recently created a search to search those sites which I think may be helpful to you too . So you can explore it too . The link is <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje">http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje</a>  Good Luck guys . Explore the search engine and grab the Zend Framework .  Bye for now . You can see some from me too in the coming days . lol  Have created the base files need to start your zend framework project . Check it out from <a href="http://harikt.com/content/base-files-start-your-zend-framework-project">http://harikt.com/content/base-files-start-your-zend-framework-project</a> .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying the Zend framework . So these are some of the things that I have learned after the start .  Hope you have installed and configured Zend framework .Please do use some nice IDE&rsquo;s like the Eclipse PDT or Aptana or the Zend Studio . The IDE&rsquo;s are very helpful when you work on projects with zend framework . Please add the include path to Eclipse so it will automatically show the list of methods and members available . Also please do look the coding standards that every one is following especially the Zend .  1 ) Creating a project  # zf create project mysite  *mysite is the name of the project  2 ) Creating a controller  # zf create controller user  * user is the controller . You can use the small letters itself . The command line will add UserController class .  # zf create action login user  * login is the action , user is the controller .  So the code will produce loginAction method in the class UserController .  3 ) You can create a module for admin using  # zf create module admin  4 ) Creating a controller for module  # zf create controller add 1 admin  5 ) Creating an action for add controller in the admin module  # zf create action blog add 1 admin  You can see help also . Just type zf will show you the all available options .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all Happy Independence day . As India is celebrating its Independence I thought of writing a post about Drupal theme that I love . This is my personal opinion . So you can explore the drupal themes section for your selection . After learning more and more about drupal , I started updating this . So I may want to say these are not the 6 , but the different themes that I love . Recently I fall in love with fusion .   <strong>Genesis</strong> : The reason I love it are Flexible layout  : Every design is having a similar layout. I don&rsquo;t think there is not much different layouts . The layout seems to be same . The things that changes are color, images and contents ( lol ).  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3823907806_cd0487d679.jpg" alt="Genesis drupal theme" />  You may never agree with me that this is a good design if and only if you know how to change the style of this theme , like adding some nice graphics etc .  <strong>Zen</strong> : The next wonderful theme that I love is zen for as I described above .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2675/3823926530_3bc27ee92f.jpg" alt="Zen drupal theme" />  <strong>Acquia Marina</strong> : If you are looking the design with out much changes , then this theme Acquia Marina is the one I love . I have made some changes to make it work as a flexible one rather than sticking on to a particular width . I hope IE users also don&rsquo;t have much problem as I am only using GNU/Linux. And I can gaurantee one thing that Mozilla users will not be having any issues .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3823909300_b7ecbd195b.jpg" alt="Acquia drupal theme" />  <strong>Waffles</strong> : Another flexible theme by the same providers of Acquia Marina .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/3823910446_072aed37e5.jpg" alt="Waffle drupal theme" />  <strong>Black Mamba</strong> : Flexible 1, 2, 3 columns like the waffles . May be having some changes to color only .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3823911616_402d0a27d8.jpg" alt="Black Mamba" />  <strong>960 Robots</strong> : From lullabot . Yes they have a video tutorial for building your own themes fr Drupal . They explains the developement of themes from scratch using this theme . The preview is available in youtube . I think buying one will not be a loss of money for any one who is new to Drupal . You can see the podcasts and blog and really will feel it.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3426/3823911904_00e7b5557e.jpg" alt="Nine sixty Robot drupal theme" />     <strong>Fusion</strong> from Top notch themes :  <a href="http://vimeo.com/7670241">Fusion Core Demo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/eternalistic">Jeremy Caldwell</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.  More over every themes are free in the website <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">http://drupal.org/project/Themes</a> . So feel free to explore and try it out .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don&rsquo;t know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying to configure my BSNL ZTE EVDO device in Open-solaris . I configured the device too, but there is little trouble now too .  Open-solaris is having a project Wireless Wide Area Network , which is run to configure the wireless networks in solaris . The link to it is <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/</a> . I configured the modem using it . You need to be root to do it too . Also some times when running a command you may not be able to read the complete contents , for it exceeds the limit . So after the command add greater than symbol followed by filename ( I hope you know these commands too ) . Eg : prtconf -v > t . You can use gedit or vim or any text editors of your choice . The documentation is so good that I don&rsquo;t need to tell more .  The below is the scripts you may need to run every time .  pppd call evdo cp /etc/ppp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf cp /etc/nsswitch.dns /etc/nsswitch.conf  The problems I am facing still now are  1 ) Speed is slow compared with Ubuntu  2 ) I can search google , but we cannot proceed to a page shown in results .  3 ) You may need to restart each time when the net is stuck . ie no packets is coming to your n/w .  I don&rsquo;t get much time to look more in google for any helps .  What I think is crtscts needs some other option . I want to try it out and will let you guys know more about this .  If anyone has already configured let me know about it . One more thing it doesn&rsquo;t ask any passwords to connect . Its having only phone number . lol &hellip;. <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was thirsty to learn a framework . It was a tough job selecting a framework too . There is a lot of frameworks for PHP . Good programming starts when you start using frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . My friend Jose Antony suggested some of them . They are  <a href="http://framework.zend.com">ZendFramework</a> : A powerful one by the PHP company Zend . Now with 1.8 there is RAD introduced . Thanks to Zend_Tool .  <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org">Symfony</a> : RAD framework by Sensiolabs . An exceptionally good documentation . Any one who is new to MVC can easily understand .  <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> : Many forum posts tell its easy to learn .  <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeignitter</a> : Many symfony users have switched to codeignitter . <a href="http://www.sajithmr.com/symfony-vs-codeigniter/">Sajith MR</a> in his blog posted also tells about why he moved from symfony to codeignitter . There may be many more guys posted about it .  <a href="http://yiiframework.com">Yii</a> : A new flexible one .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3748559244_ce4acd5e72.jpg?v=0" alt="Zend Framework in Action" />Finally my choice was zend-framework and now I am loving it . As I am new to the new MVC architecture it was little bit tough for me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" />. But recently I found a wonderful tutorial by <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a> the author of the book <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">ZendFramework in action</a> . The tutorial is an easy to learn who are new to zend-framework 1.8 .  I was not person who used to read books in my college days too . But now adays it seems I am reading a lot <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/3747769765_2ca82aefc3.jpg?v=0" alt="PHP in Action" />  <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">Zend framework in action</a> is one of the books I love to read . I hope the book zend framework in action is one of the best books to learn Zend framework . He was the advisory board member of Zend . So you can guess the remaining standard of the book .If you consider buying one , go for it . (*I don&rsquo;t get any money for it , never think so )  I saw another book PHP in action when I was looking more details about Zend Framework in Action . Just looked the table of contents . Yes it also a wonderful one if you are new to PHP .  Also the book is just a starting point , you need to look the mannual pages of <a href="http://php.net">php.net</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/">framework.zend.com</a> to learn more .  Today I found another site which is also a good one to start . Its none other than Zend Cast . Its having lots of videos for beginners . You may love it and learn from it . <a href="http://www.zendcasts.com/">http://www.zendcasts.com/</a>  Updated on 14th October 2009 :<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4008823767_bf58143231.jpg" alt="Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" />  <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a>: I got a chance to review the book &ldquo;Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development&rdquo; by Keith Pope . Its a wonderful book to learn Zend framework and many components . The book covers many commonly used components like Zend_ACL , Zend_Auth , Zend_Db , Zend_Form etc . Its really a nice book which will speedup your learning curve . You can also learn zend framework from the mannuals, but it may be easy to follow a person who is using zend framework than going single . The book covers a working example creating a shopping cart . It also uses good programming practices like unit testing with phpunit , debugging with xdebug etc . You can get a copy of the book from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">packt publishers</a>. Its available in ebook and hardcopy . You will defnitely get the return once you have the book .  Hope you too will enjoy reading the book like me . I have posted my review <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">here</a> .</p>

I got the login screen which asks for my password again though I am logged into gmail .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2521/3742249876_e74336d736.jpg?v=0" alt="Login screen to google voice" />  I logged into it . But alas it just shows me a screen . its not in your country and its only for US now , and in the future will be available  .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3450/3742249870_3677ccf1de.jpg?v=0" alt="Google voice is not available in your country" />  Hm I was thinking, if its not for India now then why do they need to send an invitation . The google has geoip to find from where a user is browsing . So they can ignore me . May be the coder doesn&rsquo;t utilises those great function . Anyway Thanks to google for the nice invitation .</p>
