  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have registered an account for google voice some weeks before. Today I got an invitation from the google team . I was really excited to see it . With in a few seconds I clicked the link to test it . I got the login screen which asks for my password again though I am logged into gmail .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2521/3742249876_e74336d736.jpg?v=0" alt="Login screen to google voice" />  I logged into it . But alas it just shows me a screen . its not in your country and its only for US now , and in the future will be available  .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3450/3742249870_3677ccf1de.jpg?v=0" alt="Google voice is not available in your country" />  Hm I was thinking, if its not for India now then why do they need to send an invitation . The google has geoip to find from where a user is browsing . So they can ignore me . May be the coder doesn&rsquo;t utilises those great function . Anyway Thanks to google for the nice invitation .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t know any of you know why education is needed ? Whats the value of education in life ?  According to me , education does&#8217;nt means only knowledge gained from an institution or getting a degree . Its making a person as a human . Many of you may disagree with me . I have found many people who have a PHD even fails to recognise human <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  A best example I can show you that many of the Keralites are still not educated is many people strikes against the introduction of a chapter &ldquo;മതം ഇല്ലാത ജീവന്‍ &rdquo; in the 7th standard. I don&rsquo;t know why every one complains about the chapter . India is a country rich with many religions , that may be the unity of India too . Look our neighbours Pakisthan , Bangladesh and all . Do you want a country like that ?  I don&rsquo;t know who my Ancestor&rsquo;s is . You may be knowing upto your grand father . A man is born without  a religion or caste . But when they grow they are quarelling on the basis of caste and religion . I remember the old song &ldquo;മനുഷ്യന്‍ മതങ്ങളെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചു &hellip;&rdquo; , every one may love the song , but is never recognising the meaning and words .  So guys its time to wake up . Act wise , this is what education is <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All may be hearing about the buzz word Ruby on Rails. So I thought to peep into What Ruby on Rails is . I thought of getting exited by Ruby on Rails , so watched the video <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov">http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov</a> . Yes I was really excited.  But can we compare Ruby on Rails with PHP ? Never you should not compare Ruby on Rails with PHP. Then Why isnt ?  Yes , PHP  and Ruby are two languages used for web-development . Rails is a MVC framework for the programming language Ruby . There are lots of frameworks for PHP like the zend framework from the supporters of PHP , yii , symfony , PHPCake , Code Ignitter and much more . You can see similar examples to get excited in PHP frameworks . So you can compare rubyonrails with zend-framework , code-ignitter , yii , symfony or any . PHP has a wide range of frameworks , does Ruby have something like this ? I don&rsquo;t know . So sorry .  I have read in a blog why Ruby on Rails went to some what popular . Its mainly because, at that time PHP was not purely object oriented. I don&rsquo;t remember where I read about it . Anyway one was in <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org">phpclasses.org</a> . Manuel Lemo has made it some what clear about it .  Recently I was arguing with one of my collegue that , PHP is secure, but you need to code it correctly . He told me that PHP lags security . Yes, it may lacks security when you code not propery . As the web now adays is dynamic and getting information from users, you should properly validate the inputs, else it may cause a serious damage to the site and server ( I agree , its not only the case of PHP , every web <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  PHP now adays have good number of frameworks which will do almost all things to make secure . But its very sad that many of the PHP developers are still using without frameworks . Frameworks increases the productivity . No one knows the working of many sites, but many of the websites are insecure .  The developers need to be careful and should know the attacks that will happen to a website when its live . But many people fails to do the necessary actions. Your design may look good , but it may lags security <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/devil_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So try to move using some nice frameworks .  So PHP  with some frameworks can be compared with rubyonrails .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gmail has introduced the voice and video chat for a while .  But its still not available for GNU/Linux . The screenshot of it when I checked for the plugin is given below .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2620/3709843567_1253d9e49c.jpg?v=0" alt="gmail voice and video chat plugin" />  Google has announced the Google Chrome OS in the 2010 , which will be running on the top of Linux Kernel . I am hoping that the voice and video chat will be available from 2010 for GNU/Linux systems .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may forget some of your passwords when its not used often . Its really a painful process for me as I am having lots of accounts . I don&rsquo;t love to make the same password for every one. So forget password link always helps you . You may need to open the secondary email and configure the new password. Recently google has launched a new service . You can enter your mobile number , so the new password will be send to your mobile. So you don&rsquo;t need to open some other mail and get the password .( Or if you have forget the password of that then <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  You can sign into <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/">https://www.google.com/accounts/</a> and add a phone number in the SMS tab . Screenshot of it is attached .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/3710605492_9735670a27.jpg?v=0" alt="Gmail password on your cell phone" />  Note : Please do not give your connection to some one else if you have added this option . Do confirm that the number typed is your mobile number itself .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zimbra is an opensource desktop application software . Its for GNU/Linux and Mac OS from Yahoo . Zimbra is another Yahoo company one like the delicious book mark management <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />. I was using Mozilla Thunder bird , but when I saw Zimbra with much more features than that , I thought of trying it .  Yes its having nice features, I love the look of it. Its based on the Mozilla . Some of the features are having calendar in it . So we can organise calendars , check emails whether its Yahoo, Gmail , MSN , AOL , Zimbra, Hot mail or any  from it . You can check your flickr images from Zimbra.  There is a slight problem with Zimbra connecting to flickr . Though Zimbra is a yahoo company its having trouble getting pictures from the flickr ( run by yahoo itslef ).  The screen shot is shown here to see how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/3697516753_a82ee6abbe.jpg?v=0" alt="Zimbra running on Ubuntu Desktop of Hari K T" />  When we try to check the flickr pics, it asks for authentication and we can authenticate to our yahoo account . We can upload pictures from the new window , but I don&rsquo;t find a scroll bar to scroll down . We can use the Tab to got to the submit buttons . I don&rsquo;t know whther yahoo have tested this in Ubuntu . Also don&rsquo;t know whether the issue is only for me . Another one is it creates a short cut to start Zimbra desktop . But icon is not appearing and also asks whether we need to run it . The screen shot of trying to upload pictures through Zimbra is below.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3698385622_a9965aab3d.jpg?v=0" alt="Zinbra accessing the flickr" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are the steps that are needed to make a database connection to run queries inside the aptana IDE .  Click the Database Perspective . Right click and add Database . Enter a name to recogise easy for you .  ( Picture below shows it )  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3694154069_10f353d8c5.jpg?v=0" alt="First screen shot , how to run mysql queries inside aptana studio" />  Clicking Next will ask you for the username and password and the connection string . The user name and password is that of your mysql db . Hope you have already installed MySQL .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2669/3694154075_ab66c55792.jpg?v=0" alt="Connection string for aptana studio" />  The connection string is <strong>jdbc://mysql://localhost:3036/</strong>  when its ok you can test it and check whether it works fine .  Connecting to server is jdbc://mysql://www.domain.com:port/  I too have searched to find the solution . Got it from Aptana forum . The forum is great, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it .</p>
