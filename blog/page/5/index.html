  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have read my earlier posts, you know I started to love templating
library like Twig, Mustache etc. So I was interested to in-corporate Twig
or PhlyMustache or any sort of templating library to auraphp.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web">Aura.Web</a> makes it easy to do
without much hassle. What you want to do is create the class which
extends the <code>Aura\Web\Renderer\AbstractRenderer</code> and have a exec() method.
For more details checkout <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web/tree/develop#data-and-rendering">Data and Rendering</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
namespace Vendor\Package\Web\Renderer;

use Aura\Web\Renderer\AbstractRenderer;

class YourRender extends AbstractRenderer
{
    public function exec()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you should pass an object of Vendor\Package\Web\Renderer\YourRender to your controller.</p>

<p>Currently I have added support for <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> in <a href="http://github.com/harikt/Hari.Extras">Hari.Extras</a> . I will be adding support for
PhlyMustache in the coming days. Hari.Extras comes with unit tests.</p>

<p>Running unit tests :
To run tests you should first install the dependencies. You can run
{syntaxhighlighter class=&ldquo;php&rdquo;}composer.phar install &mdash;dev{/syntaxhighlighter}
This will install the dependencies like Aura.Web, Aura.Framework, Twig, vfsstream etc in vendor folder.
Now you can run the phpunit from tests folder.</p>

<p>A big Thanks to @Paul M Jones and Chris Hartjes and all who have supported
one way or the other giving me tips and tricks, motivation to make this happen.
The nice thing is with composer for I don&rsquo;t need to keep everything in the tests folder.
 Thanks to @Jordi</p>

<p>By the way as <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> is getting closer and closer for the next release
I am planning to start a series of posts to get started with using the components. Stay tuned :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Paul M Jones wrote earlier <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/2487">When Possible, Use File *Resources* Instead Of File *Names*</a> and in comments <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard">Chris Hartjes</a> was mentioning about <a href="http://vfs.bovigo.org/">vfsStream</a>. So for <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">@auraphp</a> we thought of making to support vfsStream. What the hell it is? vfsStream is a PHP stream wrapper for a virtual file system that may be helpful in unit tests to mock the real file system. It can be used with any unit test framework, like PHPUnit or SimpleTest. So without touching the file system and not bothering too much about the operating system, file permissions, disk quota, removing the files created by tests on tear down etc we can make use of vfsstream. Lets start Go and get it via composer.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> So now we have created a complex structured file system. How can we check whether the structure is same?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nx">vfsStream</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">inspect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">vfsStreamPrintVisitor</span><span class="p">());</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> Now you have the structure how can you get the contents of the file you have created?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nx">file\_get\_contents</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">vfsStream</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;root/Core/badlocation.php&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> Or you can do via</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$root</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">getChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Core/badlocation.php&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">\</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">getContent</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> The question was raised by myself at <a href="https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/issues/48">https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/issues/48</a> . You can create directory and use vfsStreamPrintVisitor to see how the structure will be</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nb">mkdir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">vfsStream</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;root/Core/AnEmptyFolder/hello&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span> <span class="nx">vfsStream</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">inspect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">vfsStreamPrintVisitor</span><span class="p">());</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> There is more documentation how you can use in phpunit or have a look into the recent commits on <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/commit/f39e3452116072a3fe7f529584acb862a76fe15e">Aura.View</a> For more documentation have a look into <a href="https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/wiki">https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/wiki</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>May be the question is so simple for you. But many times I feel it much complicated. Everyone would have started their website with a custom cms and later moved to Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or something similar. I used to look for a better book in any language which has design decisions made for the cms to make it such a way that it can be extended. Some of the books that seems interesting to me are 1 ) <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430218791">Pro Zend Framework CMS</a> 2 ) <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition/book">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a> It will be great to see if you have came across such books or do you recommend any other books. I am not just looking for PHP, but I am interested to read any sort of books, which will help me to build the next blogger. Waiting to hear you suggestions on the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 13th edition of Barcamp kerala is on November 4th. This time I am going to talk on Dependency Management with Composer. In the 12th Barcamp I talked about Aura , and it was a bit technical , so Kenny was making sure, not to go for intensive code. So the talk will not be limited to composer. I will be giving you an introduction to Eath , and also a small project which I have done for my personal use fbsearch. The tool is used to search your own status messages you have posted some months back. Its still on alpha for I didn&rsquo;t get enough time to move on to make it much more better. It has some issues which I am already aware of. So if you are interested , be there :) .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working with different open-source projects for a while. Most of them utilizes phpdocumentator2 . I liked it for a while. But I have been looking at apigen, swami etc. Recently I started to make use of apigen extensively. What made me comfortable with apigen than phpdocumentator ? Certain times we may want to look into the code also to see the implementation . I am not sure may be there is an option in phpdocumentator that it can show the code when we click on a function / method. The code highlighting and is shown once we click on it. I like this feature the most. If you haven&rsquo;t yet checked how the apigen generated api looks have a look into the one for the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project</a> which is at <a href="http://harikt.github.com/api">http://harikt.github.com/api</a> More information on a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://apigen.org>apigen.org&#8221;>http://apigen.org>apigen.org</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am really excited and at the same time a bit nervous, that I will be giving a workshop on <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for PHP</a> at <a href="http://www.osidays.com/">osidays</a>, which will be held at NIMHANS convention center Bangalore on 12-14 th of October 2012. I have received only the confirmation call, but not any mail as of now. If you have never heard of osidays, its one of the Asia&rsquo;s largest open-source conference held. The workshop will be for around 3 Hours. I will be walking you through different components of aura and finally to show how you can use the individual libraries as a framework. If you have never heard about the aura project, its an independent library which can be dropped at any codebase. You can find the source code and more information of the project at <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a> . I know 3 Hours of continuous speech is a huge challenge. I will try my level best to make the workshop interesting. I will be also discussing with <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a> how I can make it more informative. In-order to attend the workshop I feel you need to grab the platinum pass. Looking forward meeting you guys at osidays :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started my career with PHP I have been hearing about PEAR and Symfony a lot. <a href="http://joseantony.com/">Jose Antony</a> was the person who introduced the names <a href="http://symfony-project.org">Symfony</a>, <a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a>, <a href="http://propelorm.org">Propel</a> etc. But at work I never got a chance to touch on those. But my thirst to learn and explore moved me from Cochin to Bangalore and different websites. I played with Symfony in my free time ( Jobeet ). symfony-project was having good articles and videos to move with. I was working for a client who was interested in <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> and asked me to go for a try. It was a hard time in 2009 for me that, the documentation was poor ( from a point of me ) and there wasn&rsquo;t a proper structure for people doing Zend Framework before the introduction of ZF tool in 1.8 ( I guess ) . The way it works and I wasn&rsquo;t either familiar with irc or how I can get some help. Yes it was mainly not the Zend Framework or the community issues. It was my problems to understand from where I can get help. There wasn&rsquo;t a good source to ask how I can use irc or get more information other than search internet. I really struggled with Zend Framework. Google was the only help which can find blog posts on errors and implementation. Some will work, some will not. I still remember the autoload error thrown which mentioned about this will be deprecated in Zend Framework 2 ( IIRC ). lol I wasn&rsquo;t either able to understand looking at those errors. I was having a thought that frameworks cannot be developed by people like me :) . Why I thought so was I was hearing about design patterns a lot and I never properly understood what the hell it was. I failed to find a good mentor. I wrote some blog posts on <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">zend framework</a> to help people who start with it. I wasn&rsquo;t either sure whether I was doing the right things. When I published the post, I did submitted a small intro to <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> with a note to verify whether I was doing it right. But the editor was busy that he mentioned its not possible to check. But some how it was published in <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> . I looked for the person who submitted the article and found it was <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt</a>. I never know about him earlier, but later understood he was the person behind <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> itself :) . In the mean time I did made some changes to the brief information at <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> and submitted it. The article brought lots of visitors and my 1 GB bandwidth got exceed for the 1st time in my life. My friend <a href="http://prajizworld.com">Prajith</a> who was in charge of the server quickly increased the limit when he got my call. This article brought me some opportunity to work with <a href="http://packtpub.com">Packt publishers</a>. Around 2009 or 2010 I came to know about a project called <a href="http://lithify.me">lithium</a> via a podcast. I was interested to learn how the frameworks are build. It was using the awesome PHP 5.3 , so I thought of looking into it. At osidays <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcoallier">David Coallier</a> gave an awesome talk on PHP 5.3 . I was able to meet <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org">Fabien Potencier</a> and get an autograph signed. I did meet some awesome PHP gurus at osidays. I started to look more closely into lithium which was in development. I wasn&rsquo;t able to help for I was not that much strong on the concepts. They were using their own git server hosted at <a href="http://dev.lithify.me">dev.lithify.me</a> . I was not comfortable with <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>, but when we search for git related help, it will be from <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> docs. So I asked about switching the lithium to github for the leaders were having their own reasons to host it there. As I told I was starting with git, I pushed to master in my fork which I wasn&rsquo;t either sure how I can send Pull Request . Again not the problem with the leaders. <a href="https://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/gwoo">Gwoo</a> etc helped me a lot when I got stuck with cloning the repo and errors. I learned some of the git commands, PHP 5.3 etc. I tried to help with testing the mysql stuffs which was done by <a href="https://github.com/Howard3">Howard</a>. Though I tried to contribute stuffs it didn&rsquo;t happened for I failed to understand the process completely. I also looked closely <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a>, but was a bit hard for me. In the early 2011 I got introduced to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for php</a> via the blog post of <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a>. I have earlier looked <a href="http://solarphp.com">SolarPHP</a> , so he was a familiar face. I started to play with it. I also understood the design principles were clearly <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp">mailed in the group</a>, so I found the real mentor whom I was searching. IIRC I forked the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com">auraphp.github.com</a> and made some changes to the style from that of <a href="http://friendsofsymfony.github.com">friendsofsymfony.github.com</a> , and probably that was my first commit to an opensource project . I started to talk on irc and give some patches and bug reports and slowly I became a member of the organization <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> . I know my earlier commits were not going on the right way( I mean the git workflow ), but Paul did merged than closing it or gave suggestions what to do and why you should not go that way etc. He do gave credits for the bugs or suggestions we share in group. Yes it was real joy for people when your commits to an open-source is merged and when you get credits for the work you do. I have noticed people who do just close the PR for there was some error the way the PR is given or if its not the way its expected. I encourage leaders to at-least correct the mistakes than closing the PR with another commit which is already waiting for merge. People who come to open-source are interested to share and learn, not just download the code and use what you are building. They loved to hear why you choose the particular design pattern than blindly using with it, at-least me love it. Note : There is no hatred to any of the projects or leaders. Every one has tried to help me learn various stuffs. It was my failures, to understand it. I fear sometimes the way we think to express may not be read between words. That is the main reason I have kept this note. I know I have not covered everyone and many of the stuffs have been missed. But its not intentionally . But I would like to Thank all for the various helps you have provided via irc, twitter, facebook, mails etc. I did had a great time learning new stuffs. Thanks once again, lets share and learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Note : First I thought of creating an issue, and it was not in github. These are not serious issues, but just my thoughts when installing ZF2 via composer. I am not sure whether its composer related or the way the zf2 is packaged to do it via composer. Normally the composer.json will be something like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zend-form&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies &ndash; Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 25%^C hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ^C {/syntaxhighlighter} But you can see the composer tries to install the whole zend-framework. The problem is you need to add some more lines for its hosted in packages.framework.com and not in packagist.org . So your composer.json will be as below . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zend-form&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies &ndash; Installing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% zendframework/zend-form suggests installing zendframework/zendservice-recaptcha (ZendService\ReCaptcha component) Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} Great you installed the zf2 form component. Now you can see where the form is installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ Annotation FieldsetInterface.php composer.json Fieldset.php Element FieldsetPrepareAwareInterface.php ElementInterface.php FormFactoryAwareInterface.php Element.php FormInterface.php ElementPrepareAwareInterface.php Form.php Exception TODO.md Factory.php View {/syntaxhighlighter} Assume you have more zf2 packages which you have added. At a later point you think of installing the framework as a whole itself than adding more packages in the composer.json . So your composer.json will be some what like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zendframework&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar update Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies &ndash; Removing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) &ndash; Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} The form has been removed and framework is installed. Lets have a look where its installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [ { &ldquo;type&rdquo;: &ldquo;composer&rdquo;, &ldquo;url&rdquo;: &ldquo;<a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>&rdquo; } ], &ldquo;require&rdquo;: { &ldquo;zendframework/zendframework&rdquo;: &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ bin INSTALL.md README-DEV.md resources composer.json library README-GIT.md tests demos LICENSE.txt README.md vendor hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/Zend/ Authentication Di InputFilter Mvc Stdlib Barcode Dom Json Navigation Tag Cache Escaper Ldap Paginator Text Captcha EventManager Loader Permissions Uri Code Feed Log ProgressBar Validator Config File Mail Serializer Version Console Filter Math Server View Crypt Form Memory ServiceManager XmlRpc Db Http Mime Session Debug I18n ModuleManager Soap {/syntaxhighlighter} You can notice its going on the wrong place. vendor/zendframework/zend-form . I am not sure whether every one needs to remove all the installed packages to install the framework . It seems possible with naming zendframework/package . Thus it don&rsquo;t remove the installed packages. May be there are some other issues related to it for the naming of zendframework/zend-form like that.</p>
