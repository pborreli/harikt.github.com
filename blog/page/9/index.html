  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may be knowing that I have been playing with <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">Aura</a> components for the past few months . The Aura is a PHP 5.3 collection of library . Its the next major release of Solar PHP framework of Paul M Jones. If you want to use it as a framework the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/system">system</a> makes it possible. Aura uses dependency injection in the core .  I have been trying different things with the aura , testing, fixing some bugs if any and pull to it etc . Currently I have an example repo which will help you to get started .  <a href="https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers">Bridge.Careers</a> contains different branches, the ViewHelper branch will help you to learn how to create your own view helpers . The MInSrc branch is set of Model related files you want to integrate Aura.Sql in the Aura framework . In the branch the models reside in the src folder itself .  You may also see other branches in the coming days.  Play with it and let us know what you have in your mind .  <a href="https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers">https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers</a>  Code of Aura PHP : <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a>  Aura PHP Website : <a href="http://auraphp.github.com/">http://auraphp.github.com/</a>  Still have some components missing( I mean Porting the Solar components ), but don&rsquo;t worry we will be coming with it in the coming days, or you can even contribute to it. You can join and discuss with us in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp">http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp</a> or in #auraphp irc channel at freenode.net .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>AuraPHP</strong> : AuraPHP is not a new framework, its by Paul M Jones who is one behind the bench marking of PHP frameworks and also the Solar PHP framework. A good thing I loved in AuraPHP is all things are discussed and implemented by Paul and the team in google groups. So you never miss bcoz your timezone is different. You always know what is happening, also if you love to know how a framework should be developed its good to join in the discusssion. I learned a lot from Paul and many of them in the group. The name was changed beacuse they don&rsquo;t want to confuse with the solar search project, else it would have been called Solar2 :) . Its developed as component based framework, but if you want to utilize whole framework then the system is for it. Some of the components are already available in github. They are the Dependency Injection , Router , Signal ( Event driven ) , Command Line , Http Request and Response , View etc .  Grab it from : <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a>  Support : on IRC FreeNode #auraphp , <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp">http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp</a> ( Discussions usually happen in groups , ie always a + point )  Current : Slow Development  <strong>FatFree</strong> : Fatfree is another nice light weight framework ( 55K ) which already may have got some attention from <a href="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/php-fat-free-framework/Jason_Gilmore04052011.php3">phpbuilder</a> article.  Grab it from : <a href="http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/">http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/</a>  Support : FreeNode #fatfree channel  <strong>Flow3</strong> : Flow3 is one of the promising framework founded by the TYPO3 association for the next development of TYPO3. Yes TYPO3 from version 5 will be using this new framework. It uses many of the concepts like AOP ( Lithium uses it ) , Signal Slot ( Zend , Aura etc ) etc. Flow3 is always a good one to check for they have a huge experience building websites with PHP. The major pitfalls of a framework or a system is understood once you start developing an application. So Flow3 tries to resolve most of the problems as they would have came when building a CMS like TYPO3.  Grab it from : <a href="http://flow3.typo3.org/download/">http://flow3.typo3.org/download/</a>  Current Version : Beta  Support : IRC , Mailing List  <strong>FuelPHP</strong> : Beware its not a PSR-0 Standard one. I don&rsquo;t recommend until you are sure you love it. When Fuel started I do have written in the comments of Dan Horrigan blog. Why you need to write another framework for 5.2, but later they decided to move it to 5.3 ie great to hear. And the latest post by Phil Sturgeon also made me think he is right . Why we want to reinvent a wheel :) . Inbuilt ORM and OIL which will make your life easier. FUEL is a good one to check. Phil Sturgeon is the Engineer for the Codeignitter Reactor . Hope you know codeigniter and reactor ;) .  Grab it from : <a href="https://github.com/fuel/fuel">https://github.com/fuel/fuel</a>  Support : <a href="http://fuelphp.com/forums">http://fuelphp.com/forums</a>  Released  <strong>Lithium</strong> : Lithium is a light weight framework for those who hate frameworks. People who are behind Lithium are Nate Abele ( X lead developer of cake php ) , Gwoo ( x project leader of cake php ) , Win Sinchlair ( x lead developer of zend ), David Persson, Joel Perras are some of them.  The most interesting thing I loved in Lithium is the filter system. Lithium will defnitely teach you to write Beautiful Code .  Grab it from : <a href="https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/framework">https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/framework</a> or <a href="http://lithify.me">http://lithify.me</a> ( Need to create an account )  Support : FreeNode #li3 channel  Current Version is 0.99 * .  <strong>Symfony2</strong> :  Symfony2 is indeed the fastest growing and may be the next largest community driven framework. The main contributor of Symfony is Fabien Potentier who is the founder of Sensio Labs and ofcourse its backed by them. Symfony2 uses many of the concepts from symfony 1 and also decoupling the framework to components something like previously Zend framework was doing. So you can utilize symfony2 components seperately without using the whole framework.  Grab it from : <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony">https://github.com/symfony/symfony</a>  Support : Group and IRC .  Current Version : Released 2.0.3  <strong>Silex</strong> : A microframework based on Symfony2  <a href="https://github.com/fabpot/Silex">https://github.com/fabpot/Silex</a> . Silex can utilize many of the symfony2 components , swiftmailer , forms etc . Fabien is also working on a small admin generation tool.  <strong>Zend</strong>: Zend framework 2 development has started. From the latest webinars I came to know they will be releasing a stable version in this year.  Grab it from : <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2">https://github.com/zendframework/zf2</a>  Support : ? , I am not sure whether there is #zf2 support in irc is happening.  An interesting thing is mostly all the above frameworks utilizes phpunit , as the unit testing suite. So you can grab phpunit and this will help in the TDD development of any any product which utilizes phpunit. I love AuraPHP &rsquo;s implementation of phpunit inside it. So there is no tedious task installing and configuring phpunit for aura. Hands of to Paul for the wonderful way he has done.  Another notable one is Doctrine2 which can be used by all the frameworks . ie also a great thing that you just need to know one ORM and utilize it every where. Especially if you are like me, and are working on different projects which uses different frameworks.   If you love doctrine, the best framework which utilizes it in the core is Symfony. Symfony2 has a better documentation, and it will improve too for you can see the community.  Lithium was mainly concentrating on nosql ( built in support from 0.3 I guess ), the RDBMS support still in progress ( Rome was not built in a day ). Lithium tries to make everything that a developer needs into the core. For the same it has more todo ( RDBMS ) though you can utilize other libraries. Its one of the promising framework once it reaches 1.0 . Never ever forget to check.  Check the latest and utilize according to your needs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have read my post on OSI Days you may have already heard about <a href="http://www.vrana.cz/">Jakub Vrana</a>. Jakub Vrana is one of the active contributors of <a href="http://php.net">php.net</a> . He introduced <a href="http://www.adminer.org/">adminer</a> and <a href="http://www.notorm.com/">NotORM</a> before us at OSI Days.  After that I have been promoting <a href="http://www.adminer.org/">adminer</a>, to my friends and collegues who were mostly using <a href="http://phpmyadmin.net">phpmyadmin</a>. Also if you were on phpmyadmin groups you may already have gone through the conversation with Jakub Vrana.  I am not going into it and why I prefer Adminer, its all personal preference. Anyway my friends who started using are impressed with this single php file which can do almost all stuffs which they have been doing in phpmyadmin, and additionaly which is fast, secure and powerful tool.  Today I replaced completely the mysql query browser which was consuming around 10MB of my hard disk with this single php file Adminer. Yes now life rocks with more MB to use as I was running out of disk space.  Also I started using <a href="http://jush.sourceforge.net/">Jush</a> . Jush is a JavaScript Syntax Highlighter which can be used for client-side syntax highlighting of following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, HTTP and SMTP protocol, php.ini and Apache config. Its available as a jQuery plugin also.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hope everyone knows about <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/">HTMLPurifier</a> and why its used. Martin Brampton&rsquo;s new book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a> includes a discussion of using HTML Purifier in your content managementsystem.  Today I thought of adding HTMLPurifier to Lithium . Its easy but sometimes we may want to look the autoloader and how its implemented. So this is a small contribution from me.  There is also another way. ie go and clone <a href="https://github.com/harikt/li3_htmlpurifier.">https://github.com/harikt/li3_htmlpurifier.</a> Download all the files to HTMLPurifier . And add Libraries::add(&lsquo;li3_htmlpurifier&rsquo;);  Hope you liked :&ndash;) . Have fun .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So now some of the relationship support has been there in lithium&rsquo;s x-relationships branch . I was talking with Howard Lince and Nateabele about the progress in relationships .  You can see the updated roadmap <a href="http://dev.lithify.me/lithium/wiki/about/roadmap">here</a> .  So lets start playing with relationships right ?  Currently we have  1 ) hasOne => 1 to 1  2 ) hasMany = > 1 to N  3 ) belongsTo => N to 1 or 1 to 1  4 ) HABTM work in progress  Eg 1 : A user has one profile . hasOne  Eg 2 : A user has many posts  Eg 3 : A user has many comments  Eg 4 : Single or many comments belongs to user .  Eg 5 : A single or many posts belongs to user .  Currently as the work for relationships is in progress I cannot point you to <a href="http://lithify.me/docs.">http://lithify.me/docs.</a> But Cake PHP has good documentation of the concepts. You can read it from <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1039/Associations-Linking-Models-">cakephp</a>  I am going to show only some snippets of code how to create relationships. Once you have done with it , you will be a master.  Note :The command &ldquo;li3 create model&rdquo; previoulsy was creating models as singular. But from now onwards its Plural, so the command may be creating singular named file. So you need to do the necessary changes , will be fixed soon before 1.0 release.  We are moving to x-relationships branch. ie  $git checkout x-relationships  What I am going to show is relationship with user and post and user with comments. I assume only registered users can add posts and comments .  So lets dive into it .  Below is the table structure  Now you want to create Comments , Posts , Users models in your app/models folder .  Comments are posted for a particular post by a user .  So we are relating it via variable belongsTo . It must be public.  The $_schema is the array which is the same order the fields are created in table.  The $validates array contains the validations needed.  A user can post many comments and posts . Here in hasMany we have shown the relationship to the other .But its not needed as lithium is smart enough to know your foreign key relationships if you followed it.  Lithium uses filters. Filters are essentially an efficient way of introducing event-driven communication between classes in your application. You can read over <a href="http://dev.lithify.me/drafts/source/en/02_lithium_basics/02_filters.wiki">filters</a> .  So in your controllers action , you can fetch data like the below.  The Post::find() fetches the post of that particular id and the user who posted it .The Comments::find() fetches the comments and the user who posted it .  If you are storing the users name , email etc in comments table and not like the one I showed then the best way is to add Comments also to the with in Post::find()  A print_r for $post->data() will show the values. You can use a filter to check whether a query is fired and dump the query.  Add the below code in bootstrap.php  Thanks to Nate Abele , Howard and all my #li3 friends who helped me to make this post.  You can see the whole things over <a href="https://github.com/harikt/li3_tests">https://github.com/harikt/li3_tests</a> . More experiments will be added to it :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh I am lazy for not posting my second cup of lithium over here . But you can check something over <a href="http://dev.lithify.me/forks/harikt/lithium_blog/wiki/home">http://dev.lithify.me/forks/harikt/lithium_blog/wiki/home</a> . So you know I am a fan boy of Lithium. I used to hang on #li3 irc just for fun, though I am not developing anything serious with lithium for now .  We used to read the documentation with the help of li3_docs plugin. Its so cool. But searching locally was not possible. If you have internet connection then it may not be a trouble too :) . Questions come and go, sometimes we may be knowing where we read it, but don&rsquo;t remember the exact controller action or the property. Oh my :&ndash;)  So I finally decided to hack on li3_docs plugin to make a search locally with the help of the Zend_Search_Lucene &rsquo;s power . You can read more about <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.overview.html">Zend Lucene component over here</a>. This is also a good point to show you that anything can be integrated with li3 ;). So no more blha blha blha . Just codes coming on the way .  First you need to create the index pointing to /searches/makeindex . Before doing that change the url according to yours. For now I assume <a href="http://lithium.local/docs/">http://lithium.local/docs/</a> which is the only part I have hard coded. Nate has agreed to look into it and make the necessary changes and we will try to make it as plugin if he loves :&ndash;). So the files are below. I hope know something about li3, li3_docs etc. This uses the extractor from li3_docs :&ndash;)  You can see how I have included the Zend library as from <a href="http://dev.lithify.me/lithium/wiki/guides/using/zend">http://dev.lithify.me/lithium/wiki/guides/using/zend</a>  Do create an empty file makeindex.html.php in the searches folder of view before creating index.  Now do your way, may be add a form and point to the controller and action or what ever you love. As always licensed under the same licene of <a href="http://lithify.me/">http://lithify.me/</a> . Hang on to #li3 on irc.freenode.net to ask anything more on it :&ndash;) .  Note : Set time limit to 0 . ie  set_time_limit( 0 ); in bootstrap.php for creating the index. The methods are called recursively and needs sometime to create the index . Once indexed you don&rsquo;t want , just query through it .</p>

All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to <strong>upgrade to PHP 5.3</strong>.&lsquo; )  There are lots of beneficts when moving to PHP 5.3 series. 5.3 is completely rewritten core, improved speed and memory utilization. For developers you need to learn something more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" />  . We have <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php">namespaces</a> , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php">Late Static Bindings</a> ,   <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php">jump labels</a> (limited goto) , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">Closures</a> (Lambda/Anonymous functions),  new magic methods, <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#language.oop5.overloading.methods">__callStatic</a> and <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#language.oop5.magic.invoke">__invoke</a> ,  <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc">Nowdoc</a> , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php">Constants</a> can now be declared outside a class using the <em>const</em> keyword,   <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary">ternary</a> operator now has a shorthand form: <em>?:</em>. , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php">Exceptions</a> can now be nested ,  garbage collector for circular references has been added, and is enabled by default etc . You can look the <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/migration53.new-features.php">new features</a> added on php.net . So before you jump to start looking for a new 5.3 series framework  you have to know what the above are .  You can use the <a href="http://in3.php.net/migration53">migration guide</a> on php.net to move your apps from 5.2 to 5.3 series . Some of the changes are <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/migration53.incompatible.php">backward incompatible</a> so will break <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Now the game starts , we have a bunch of frameworks started with PHP4 , PHP5 and now on 5.3 . Lithium is stable and many of the apps are working on top of it . Lithium has some core developers who are from Cake , Zend framework etc . And some of them were the leads of that framework. So its not brought to you by some one who don&rsquo;t have any knowledge in PHP or the community . So you have a reason to look right ? Also Lithium uses <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards">PSR-0 Final Proposal</a> of the PHP Standards Working Group, so you can bring your favourite piece of cake from any other frameworks like Doctrine , Symfony , Zend or any other which follows it . Try not to select a framework which doesnot follow the proposal and after all its your wish <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  About the documentation: Ya , there is lots to do in the documentation part , but you can use the li3_docs plugin to read all the doc block comments from the core . The core of the framework is almost compelely documented . You can see how it works from <a href="http://lithify.me/docs">http://lithify.me/docs</a> . The installation guide is here <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki/guides/installation">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki/guides/installation</a> . Its well written so I feel there is nothing I want to introduce here .  One you grabbed your copy you can download the li3_docs plugin to libraries folder and add the line Libraries::add(&#8216;li3_docs&rsquo;); at the end of config/bootstrap/library.php .  I hope you have already pointed your application to the webroot . If not some code below by <a href="http://www.rmauger.co.uk/">Ryan Mauger</a> commonly known as <a href="http://twitter.com/Bittarman">Bittarman</a> on the zf community will help you . I got some help from Bittarman, and which have helped a lot on my future projects . So I hope this will help you too .  So li3 is the command line tool which created models, controllers and does many of them .  Creating for project is as easy .I hope you have already installed and configured Lithium and li3 command line tool as <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki/guides/installation">described</a>. Lets see how and the directory structure look .  Oh simple right ? Your project is ready . Now point it changing the above name blog with hellolithium and to webroot and not public as in the previous gist. Some times this command may not work , as we expects . So the easiest way is also making a copy of the app folder and changing the name to hellolithium or the name you love . I was having some trouble but Nate helped me to resolve the issues on #li3 on freenode . Though there are not a huge fans for li3 at present the support channel is superb . You will defnitely get some helping hands on it . Nate will also be publishing a tutorial soon , so I am also looking forward on it .  So one you have pointed to the webroot it will tell you to make the resources directory writeable. All you want to do is chmod 777 for the resources directory . Now you can change your database connections from the config/bootstrap/connections.php file. Lithium comes with support for mongodb as default. But you can also use other RDBMS like MySQL , Postgre etc or you can also use Doctrine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/thumbs_up.gif" alt="image" /> . So its your wish to use what .  Moving to command line once again how to create controllers, models etc .  $li3 create &lt;name> will be creating controllers and models .  li3 create -i is used to create on an interactive way . ie once you issued , you will be getting a set of questions  $ li3 create -i What would you like to create? (model/view/controller/test/mock)  > model model could not be created.  I have not figured out why the error occurs. I know many of them are busy on their daily work . So I am looking into it , how it works and all . So you can see some other nice command line features soon on my blog.  Note : At the moment I am not a master in Li3, nor a contributor. So there may be errors from my part, sorry  and let me know if you see it and how I can resolve it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Day 1 :</strong>  <strong>Building Powerful Search in Drupal</strong> by Prajwals Manchikatla : Ya I do have loved to see what the session was. But rather than that I was interested in the talk by Bastian Feder&rsquo;s <strong>The most unknown parts of PHPunit</strong> . He walked through different code examples . He also made it clear for me how @depend works etc. Thanks for his time spending with me.  <strong>Citizen Journalism on Drupal</strong> by Markus Franz : He was telling how Drupal helped them for making Citizen Journalism. A case study . I am a little hard coded techie who loves to see some demos and codes. So it was a disappointing one for me. I didn&rsquo;t attended the <strong>Ingres 10 new features</strong>.  Dave Hall was coming with the session <strong>How to run hundreds of Drupal Sites</strong>. Though I have played with <strong>Aeigr</strong>, through twitter I have promised him that I will be there on his talk. It was an awesome session and I hope everyone has loved it. I feel many of the druplers in the room haven&rsquo;t tried aegir yet. I missed the talk of Jakub Vrana about the <strong>Adminer Editor &ndash; creating administration interface for free in PHP</strong> for both the sessions were on the same time.  Food and networking . We can see a lots of young entreprenurs. I remembered the wordings of Praseed Pai :) . I feel he is always right.  After noon session was with Fabien Potencier to know more about the <strong>Symfony2</strong>. The mic was so poor that sometimes the voice wasn&rsquo;t audible. Also in his slides the blue color( I think it was blue itself ) was not visible for me( not sure about others ). So I missed the session <strong>RDF in Drupal7 and what it means for the web at large</strong> by Gaurav Kumar. But I managed to get into it after Fabiens session and got something about RDF.  I missed <strong>Building &amp; Scaling facebook with opensource</strong> by David Recordon for I was with the session <strong>Typical architecture to scale large Drupal implementations</strong> by Denis Lafont Trevisan.  <strong>Introduction to Kaltura</strong> by Jason Levitt . He was very much worried for there was no internet connection and his laptop was not plugging properly to show the slides. Some of them went to watch the session by Markus Franz <strong>Quality Assurance in PHP projects</strong>. This would have really helped project managers. I was also there for awhile.  The awesome session that I was able to hear was by Marek Sotak who build the root candy admin theme. He moved us through <strong>What&rsquo;s new in Drupal 7 theming</strong>. People who don&rsquo;t know Drupal 6 , may not be having any problem for they are looking D7 for the first time . But it was an interesting session for those who knows Drupal 6 and also to those who want to learn D7. I missed the session by Jonathan Gray about the <strong>NoSQL overview</strong>. I hope he may have told something about MongoDB and all. Anway I want to look into his slides to know what he has covered.  <strong>Day 2 :</strong>  Event started little late around 9:20 . I will not blame Janakiraman for he was there on time . Not sure why he made a delay to start . He talks about the <strong>Windows Azure</strong> and how we can use it for PHP. Azure uses IIS . So hopefully we don&rsquo;t want to look more into Windows Azure, for many of our PHP frameworks relay on apache mod rewrite functionalities , image magick than PHP GD library. So good bye azure :) , I will live in Ubuntu cloud if I need rather than in a properitery cloud like Azure :). And the last demo failed, though he promised he will show it before he leave. But I know him and his knowledge in the cloud, so wishing him a good success. Also got a chance to chit chat with him.  Jonathan Gray introduced <strong>Handoop , HBase and Hive in Facebook</strong>. He also talks about the open-source plans about this in facebook .  Jakub Vrana the co-author of php manuals, a good teacher, the man behind adminer an alternative for phpmyadmin or we can say an admin interface for free, came with the session about notorm. I was hearing about <strong>NOTORM efficiently get relational data in PHP,</strong> for the first time, but from his examples I can understand it was something similar to the Zend_Db_Table . I enjoyed his demos and session.  Bastian Feder came up with the session <strong>Writing beautiful documentation with php Documentator</strong> . It was also a good one when we work with Eclipse , Netbeans or something like that and also for the persons who is trying to use it. ie when we build some API. Doctrine uses phpdocumentator.  Food and networking &hellip;&hellip; ;)  The next session was by Kevin Schroeder an Evangelist for Zend. I was accompaniying with him. Talking about his laptop sticker he remebered the stickers and some of the badges he have brought. Also the troubles he faced at customs for the clearence of the pin in his bag. I loved watching <strong>Using Zend Server to run your PHP Applications</strong>. He showed some demos . I used to watch webinars by Zend. So I was aware how powerful he was. He introduced the community server and some of the beneficts over it. He gave away the Zend Studio licence for a simple question. I was already having one I got from Zend ;). The stickers and badges disappeared within a few seconds when he says about it.  Gaurav Mishra came up with the session <strong>Harnessing CSS3 for a Beautiful Web</strong>. But some times he missed the clear points that need to be told like IE upto 8 was not in the consortium of w3c, and only came now. Many of them were bothered about how we can use CSS3 without bringing the same in IE6. I don&rsquo;t know why they were still bothered about IE6 , which has born in 1998 and still holding in 2010. Its like not using a motor vehicle instead rickshaw( People who lives in BC ).The opera evangalist Shwetank Dixit was present . He was an awesome guy who can really make the event a beutiful one. I have loved if those guys have given him a 10 minutes to speak about HTML5 and CSS3 . He talks to our BCK guys there and also promised a full day session of HTML5 and CSS3 soon.  <strong>PHP 5.3 a walk through</strong> by David Coallier was another awesome one. He was an active person and many of the slides and how he presented was awesome. I don&rsquo;t think if the guy was in love with PHP , would have never told him that we are in short of time. I don&rsquo;t know whether we will get such a session any more. Many of them were unhappy in the decision as PHP an open-source and than promoting an open-source talk, they gave more time for Microsoft Azure. Sorry David, but I no, we missed it :(.  Prajwals Manchikatla came up with another session on <strong>Core Concepts of worlds most misunderstood language Javascript</strong> . It was interesting with some of the examples of classes , objects and all. I loved it .  <strong>Subversion 1.7 and the future features</strong> by Senthil Kumaran S. Senthil was working as the core developer of Subversion , so he was really a nice person to talk about sub-version and its features. I know why he came up with the talk earlier than 1.7 has been realeased :) ( Git ;) ) . He talks about the changes in the library and how it will not effect when its upgraded. He also confirmed that subversion is having many clients from properiery world and so there is no way at present to move as a distributed one, for all will be having the same copy. He also says that when git works for open-source projects , svn works for properietery company who don&rsquo;t love to take the whole bunch of code to their home. He talks about the licencing changes. It was an awesome session to know how subversion works and to hear some history behind it. Some of them shared their doubts.  <strong>Day 3 :</strong>  I was with the session on <strong>Postgre 9.0 features</strong> by Ashutosh Bapat and the next talk by Chetan Suttarway about the <strong>Postgre SQL security threats and solutions</strong>. They were from the Postgre company Enterprise DB and presented it nicely. I missed the talks on <strong>HTML5 state of Art</strong> by Jason Levitt, but I think I will not for Shwetank Dixit will be coming with 1 day session on CSS3 and HTML5 in the coming months. The other session was <strong>Cloud Hosting Uncovered</strong> by Markus Franz.  <strong>Emerging Technologies for Analytics for large Data Volumes</strong> was presented by Roger Burkhardt. This session disappointed me for I thought he will be going with which DB is good for large volume and which DB is good for small volumes , search and many of the things. He was mainly talking about the Ingres Vector solution which still has not released as opensource. I went to know about the drivers so I can connect with PHP. Like pear installation and so on . But I was unsatisfied with the answer I got from the Indian guy. Don&rsquo;t know who he is. He told me to download the whole bunch of thing which I don&rsquo;t want , which my laptop is already with LAMP. I just want to download DB and the driver. So what I feel was it was not an open-source product. So I just walked away from there and I am satisfied with MySQL , Postgre, Maria, MongoDB and so on .  <strong>MySQL performace tuning , top 10 tips by Sonali Minocha</strong> : Yes she took us through some examples , how to use and where not to use EXPLAIN and such stuffs. Where to use CHAR and VARCHAR . Some of the differences and beneficts over MyISAM and InnoDB . Thanks for her tips and tricks.  Food and Networking  Other sessions after the food were <strong>Large Scale Linux Deployments-Automated Solutions</strong> by Murthy Raju and Developing and deploying top PHP applicatios on Windows with Webmatrix and WebAPI . I skipped both .  <strong>Pictures :</strong>  I do have uploaded some of the pics taken by Arun to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/kthari85/OSIDays2010">http://picasaweb.google.com/kthari85/OSIDays2010</a> . If you need a higher resolution of the pics shout at me . I am ready to send those .  <strong>Feed Back :</strong>  Feedback for an event is always good I think . Don&rsquo;t feel bad against me. I don&rsquo;t want to harm anyone , but to make it better I feel its always good. 0 ) Good to show the people who have proposed the proposals. As its an open-source event bring community rather than taking a few from the panels or something like that .  1 ) Internet connection and power plugs : I cannot live without internet . Its like oxygen for developers . I was so sad to see such a largest conference with out internet and power points on the desk . When we guys do Barcamps in Kerala, we do have internet connectivity. And I don&rsquo;t know how the guys from international level thinks about such an event :( . For the next time do have good internet connectivity and power plugs .  2 ) First day : Sunday was filled with good sessions and tight schedule . It was really a nice thing if some of the sessions were moved to third day ( We can see third was not having any :( ) . ( Seems they tried to bring many people on sunday itself and didn&rsquo;t even thought about the people who loved to hear )  3 ) There are two halls, and the two was some distance apart . The sessions on the two halls doesn&rsquo;t end on the same time . If we managing something like to cutshort the time , its good to do for every session. Rules are same for everyone :) .  4 ) Give some extra time in the chart for each session. ie around 10 minutes or so. So for a 45 minute session will bring 55 minutes , and this will not make to cutshort the time he speaks. He can take advantage of the extra time. Setting up the system and the whole bunch of stuffs.  Thanks once again for all guys at OSI Days. Hope you will take some of my suggestions .  But I missed J Wage :( and love to bring you one day. Lets see whether it works ;) . I was having a gold pass and have covered the topics as the same . There were other sessions also which I have not described anything.</p>
