  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys agian I got a chance to review the book titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-6-content-administration/book">Drupal 6 Content Administration</a>&rdquo; by J. Ayen Green published by Packt Publisher . ( The other one was <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a> by Keith Pope a wonderful book to learn Zend framework ) . If you have not heard about drupal before , the best example to show you is this website . Yes harikt.com is running on drupal , the powerful content management system ( CMS ) .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113837029/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2541/4113837029_df883e1615.jpg" alt="Drupal 6 Content Administration by Packt" /></a>  Drupal is a flexible CMS than Joomla ( with my experience ) . The flexibility come with the modules like CCK , Views , WYSIWYG editor , IMCE , poor mans cron , taxonomy etc .  Let me tell you what I felt after reading the book . This is my personal review and may be wrong , but if the below thing are added it will be an advantage .  1 ) Drupal core is just below 2Mb . Doesn&rsquo;t comes with default rich text editor . But we can extend it with modules . There are a lots of powerful third party modules . The book doesn&rsquo;t help you how to install the module. ( Page 85 The process of obtaining and installing modules is beyond the scope of this book, but the URL where they can befound is given in Appendix B. )  2 ) Drupal&rsquo;s main feature with other CMS is , they have a dedicated team for testing . They fixes and alerts the drupal users about the issues . So the drupal site must be upgraded with the latest version whether its core or modules . If you have not done , your website can be cracked by any other person who knows how to do it . Data loss is a huge loss <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I didnot see a chapter dedicated for this .  3 ) If you are looking for just a blog with out much features wordpress will do it . But the power of Drupal is to run multiple websites with a single core . ie harikt.com , drupal.org can be run from a single core of drupal . You don&rsquo;t need to go and install seperate drupal core . So upgrading modules and core is so simple . The book fails to point about it .  4 ) Just installing a module will not configure the many options in Drupal . Drupal has lots of features like roles and privileages . Though the book tells about some nice modules that every drupal site uses, it fails to show completely .  So I recommend packt to check the above things that will help to make the book better . I heard that the book is doing good and I happy to hear that it helps some . But looking the above things will make it much more better . I am interested to hear from people who have read this book , whether I have written anything wrong . My personal opinion is that this book may not help a newbie to administer drupal .  In the first installation I didnot loved Drupal , but have gone for Joomla . Later I was in love with Drupal . The community is powerful which makes me close to drupal . Some people may say a image is worth better than 1000 words <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , so I personally feels videos may be good than reading a book.  I personally look <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a> , <a href="http://lullabot.com">lullabot</a> , <a href="http://acquia.com">acquia</a> , <a href="http://learnbythedrop.com/">learn by the drop</a> ( I learned many things from this website . A big Thanks to Robert Safuto ) and many bloggers. Acquia ( run by Dries Buytaert the person behind Drupal ) and Lullabot ( I am a fan of <a href="http://webchick.net/about">Angie Byron</a> who is the Drupal 7 core maintainer ) have some core drupal developers . There many other too . I love watching some of the previews of the of <a href="http://store.lullabot.com/">store.lullabot.com</a> . Lullabot has a collection of videos to learn and master drupal . You can see what others say . I hope you too will enjoy my collections .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know you may disagree with me . But let me come to the point why I ( according to a developer view point ) thought so . Every one seems to be convinced with the frameworks and beneficts of it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113996969/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2485/4081943187_5207f8e395.jpg" alt="Zend framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702198/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4082702198_0c3d4c35f1_o.png" alt="Symfony PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702058/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4082702058_69e1f84d4a_o.png" alt="Yii framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082701908/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4082701908_53bb642a72.jpg" alt="Cake PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4081942393/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4081942393_4bceb810bc.jpg" alt="Codeigniter PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="javascript:void(0"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_506c6a9e95_o.png" alt="Lithium, light weight PHP framework" /></a>;/<em>1264915123455</em>/)  Some of the most popluar open-source frameworks are the above . I am not comparing the beneficts of each framework here . Its just in the developer perspective .  I have seen that many companies are following different styles and different frameworks for developing PHP applications . Its always nice that you do what you like and you are not forced to do the same methodology .  But we PHP Developers may need to follow a single framework rather than going behind a lots of open-source PHP frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Wait wait let me tell you why . My points may not satisfy a company , but some developers may agree with me ( I hope so ).  What&rsquo;s the benifict for developers and employers ?  Do you stick on with the same firm ? Your employee may not be productive as you thought ? Need to expand your firm ?  If so you always disagrees with me and I cannot convince you why .  Else part ( So I hope you are not )  What ever may be your skills , may be a Lion in the old firm ( with X framework ) , but when you are given Y framework ( in the new firm ) you will be a Rat . Am I right ? So here comes the benefict of using a single framework by all PHP Developers . You are the same Lion , and can go with the same speed , convince your skills in the short time , gain more and much more . Employers can recognise and get good quality coders easily. Rapid productivity from newly hired employee.  Previously Zend was not invloved developing a framework . But now they are with the open-source <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">zend framework</a> ( I think from 2007 onwards ) . Zend is the PHP company and as many frameworks are utilizing the components of Zend framework . We php developers may need to follow <del>zend only</del> one of these open-source frameworks ( After trying some of the open-source php frameworks I think we don&rsquo;t want to stick with single framework <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , but to stick with any of the popular opensource framework . You can <a href="http://harikt.com/content/benefits-open-source-frameworks-over-custom-frameworks">read the post beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom framework</a> ). Zend framework is flexible to integrate on custom frameworks . For those who love to stick on with their custom framework and wants some additional functionalities especially some of the webservices, it may be good to follow zend framework . The documentation of zend frameworks seems to be improved.  I am more attracted with <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony-project</a> for the command line features, auto generation of codes, good documentation than zend , great community. Projects like delicious, dailymotion etc are using it. Enterprise like yahoo uses it. Also we can integrate Zend components inside symfony . Fabien Potencier core developer of symfony , Matthew Weier O&#8217;Phinney lead developer of zend framework gives talks on integrating these two frameworks Symfony and Zend Framework. You can learn symfony from the symony paris 2010 on february 15 to 17. More information can be obtained from <a href="http://www.symfony-live.com/">http://www.symfony-live.com/</a>. And the good thing is Symfony 2 revealed . If you are in Paris don&rsquo;t miss this . I would have been there if I was richer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But one day I will be there to see your talk and live presentation.  Many new php frameworks are born, Lithium project seems the latest one . Lithium works only for PHP version greater than 5.3 and is under development . If you love to start working with 5.3 it may be good to make your hands dirty jumping to Lithium . The core developers are from the old cake php framework. They started this project from scratch, so they know what good and bad is . So I am sure that Lithium will be growing much more faster. You can <a href="http://harikt.com/node/120">read something about Lithium and Kohana here</a> .  Conclusion : Though I thought we php developers need a single framework , I changed my mind.  1 ) For loose components, follow Zend  2 ) Jumping to MVC to make your hands dirty for the first time ? Follow symfony , codeignitter , cake  3 ) PHP frameworks that supports PHP version 5.3 and up : lithium , symfony 2  4 ) Need some training ? symfony, cake , zend  5 ) Supporting only PHP version 5.x and up ? : Kohana , Zend , Symfony , Lithium  6 ) Still sticking with the dirty PHP 4 ? codeignitter, cake  There are lots of comparisons available. After trying some of these, I think its good to learn symfony if you are new to MVC and looking for a framework. If you are looking for a library you can go for zend.  Note : Every logos are of the respective owners . I don&rsquo;t have any copyright and my points are just what I thought in a particular moment . There may be posts telling the drawbacks and beneficts of each framework .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a long wait I too got my google wave . My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ArunBasilLal">Arun Basilal</a> got wave .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817864/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2735/4068817864_b7dac4e3c7.jpg" alt="Hari K T on google wave" /></a>  I requested him and he was ready to send me an invite and was invited on 28th October . I was waiting and waiting and google may have tested my patience . And finally today ( November 2nd ) I was telling <a href="http://twitter.com/priyanr">Priyan</a> to send me one more , as wave didn&rsquo;t reach after 48 hours .  Priyan was Happy and send me an invite . Opening gmail I was really Happy to see the the google invite from Arun Basilal of <a href="http://www.millionclues.com">Million Clues</a> . Thanks once again Priyan and Basilal .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817870/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4068817870_4986515ce4.jpg" alt="Hari K T making Google wave in action" /></a>  Not explored much in wave . I want to make experiments with it. Thanks to all and Thanks to google for making a wonderful application .  Still wondering what wave is ? Oh then the video is for you . Get inspired and rock on wave . Google wave at present needs invitation .  Hope this video made you crazy .  Updated on 07 November 2009 : After some days of using google wave I feel that google wave will not rock until every user gets one . Many are inactive for you may be having only a few people in your contacts who uses wave . So they just check wave once a day . Its a great colloborative tool, and I know that it will rocks in the future. So you guys may want to wait until you get an invite . Its always good that developers get wave invite rather than just users ;) .  11 th November 2009 : I have a very few google wave invites. If anyone is interested in it , just drop a comment . I will send it to you , if its not over . Just 8 invites are there <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So the first 8 will get it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hope every one know about mozilla firefox ( Popular open-source web browser ) . If you are a webdeveloper you may defnitely know about <a href="http://www.harikt.com/tools-for-webdevelopers/42-firebug-a-handy-tool-for-web-developers">firebug</a> which is a handy tool . But today I would like to introduce some of the wonderful tools in the mozilla labs . Some of you may have already tried and know how powerful it is .  <strong>Ubiquity</strong> :  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026231282/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4026231282_ca08c5b0ef_m.jpg" alt="ubiquity" /></a>This is a wonderful tool and every one will love the great features . We can call this as a command line tool for Mozilla firefox. Don&rsquo;t think its so hard , its the one of the best tool which will help . Just a ctrl + space will start the ubiquity command. You can insert maps , contents , translate , bookmark to delicious , search , calculate etc .  Some of you guys may know me , I love command line and this tool is a great one which is changing the mozilla . It may be sometimes part of firefox after its released from labs . You can close tabs of particular url , title etc . Open the closed urls and many more . You just need to install ubiquity addon . Check out the page <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/">http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/</a> if you are interested to see it in action .  Check out the video and get inspired  If you are in GNU/Linux , then the short cut key conflicts , so you can change the ubiquity short cut key by going to the setting tab from about:ubiquity and chaging to your desired one . I am using ctrl + space for now , and its so easy to change to your easy remembering short cuts.  <strong>Personnas :</strong>  Many of them may have already tried Personas . ( For thos who don&rsquo;t know it ). Every one love to see their browsers in a variety of style . Then personnas is for you .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026228810/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2604/4026228810_c4f01afda4.jpg" alt="Personas" /></a>  Its a light weight plugin for firefox to change the style of firefox. Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/">http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/</a>  <strong>Prism :</strong>  Again if you are a GNU/Linux user you may have already tried Prism ( If you have tried to get an alternative for gtalk ) . It can work as a stand alone application for the desktop . A google talk desktop application uses prism.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025476843/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/4025476843_074999a00b.jpg" alt="Prism" /></a>  Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/">http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/</a>  <strong>Snowl :</strong>  Snowl is a wonderful tool if you are a blog reader , if you are participating in online discussions etc . I am sure that you love snowl if you love to read feeds, which is something like google reader .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026232656/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/4026232656_fec61827f6.jpg" alt="Snowl" /></a>  You can get more information from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/snowl/">http://labs.mozilla.com/snowl/</a>  <strong>Weave :</strong>  So you need encryption before sending data, to make your data more secure . Yes weave does encryption in client side and transfer data . It uses cryptographic engine for encryption . You can store all your personal data in a weave server secure. You need to have a weave account for it. 3 party integartion is possible with weave .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026232002/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4026232002_42baf625fd.jpg" alt="Weave" /></a>  More information about the addon can be found in <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/weave/">http://labs.mozilla.com/weave/</a>  <strong>Test Pilot</strong> :  Testing is always an important factor in software development . The cost of testing will be more than the actual development of software . So if you love to give a feed back to the mozilla firefox, they can make the product much more better and can make the product the way you are looking . So its your time to get involved and participate with testing and make the user experience better and better .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025478051/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/4025478051_90fe1c5b50.jpg" alt="test pilot" /></a>  More information can be obtained from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/testpilot/">http://labs.mozilla.com/testpilot/</a>  <strong>Bespin</strong> :  Bespin is called as code in the cloud .

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008823767/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4008823767_bf58143231.jpg" alt="Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" /></a>   Hi guys , I got a chance to review the book &ldquo;Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development&rdquo; by Keith Pope published by Packt. I was glad to hear that they have choosen me as one of the reviewer . Let me tell you something how I came to review the book and my experience in Zendframework . After completing my Btech from Calicut University Institute of Engineering and Technology ( CUIET ) joined ISPG technologies Cochin as PHP developer from November 2007, and was interested to learn one of the frameworks like symfony , cake , codeignitter , zf , yii . It was my client Christopher Van Ittersum of Design customs who pushed me to learn ZF .     I started learning ZF after more than 1.5 years of experience developing web applications with PHP. Developed a simple blog using ZF and posted it here which was later published in devzone ( <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/9755-A-simple-blog-with-Zend-Framework-1.9">http://devzone.zend.com/article/9755-A-simple-blog-with-Zend-Framework-1.9</a> ) pushes me to write a review for “<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a>” by Keith Pope . <strong>Introduction/summary:</strong>     <a href="http://zend.com">Zend</a> “The PHP company” who is behind <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend framework</a> ( ZF ) is one of the fastest growing opensource PHP frameworks . This book is for those who know PHP and want to learn ZF or use the components . ( If you are a newbie to MVC then its like jumping to sea without a life jacket , so this book is a jacket ) . When I started reading the book I started loving it and I hope you too will defnitely love reading it. <strong>What’s the book about?</strong> The “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” book is really useful for those who want to learn Zend framework or who wants to use the ZF library in their projects . You must have some knowledge about PHP and OOP. It teaches you the mostly used zendframework components and thus improving your knowledge and shortening the learning curve. <strong>Does it achieve its promises?</strong> I was new to ZF and MVC, so I hope every like me have the same views . Many people says ZF has great docs and is easy to learn . According to me, the curve is steep , but once you learned it , you will be comfortable in it . So to climb up you need a ladder . This book is a ladder for you to learn ZF which will shorten your learning cure . It starts with a small “Hello world” application which uses the zf commands like the one used by quickstart and explains each and every details. When the book was written ( according to the author) , the command zf create module <module name\> was not available and he has created modules folder manually and so the cart doesn&rsquo;t use the zf commands. But the structure is same. The module is the one everyone new to ZF will try to learn like the database connection . This book uses some modules , so it will help you to learn about module structure . The other toughest part every person searching will the Zend_Acl and Zend_Auth which is also covered . You can learn some about unit testing with phpunit and debugging with xdebug . The book covers how to install and configure these . You will learn some of the techniques to beautify a form using the Zend_Form , also how to make pretty urls.  First I thought of writing a small comparison, after downloading the source code from Manning ( &ldquo;Zend framework in Action&rdquo; by Rob Allen of <a href="http://akrabat.com">http://akrabat.com</a> ) and Packt , but later thought of leaving it ( cannot compare 1.6 with 1.8 ). If you are interested you can try it out . According to me the Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development will really help you reducing the learning curve as its having a good example as shopping cart . <strong>Conclusion :</strong> The book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” will really help you learning ZF in a better way. Every book , has its own limitations as when the book is ready to release many new features will be introduced and some features will be deprecated. Also writing a blog post itself is tedious job , so what about writing a book ? He has tried to help you learn ZF very well without much mistakes . So the book is not the last step to learn ZF, but will help you learn zend framework quickly. The one thing I have noticed working with the example was you need to configure virtual host else the style sheets will not be taken . ie <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> and have some trouble with <a href="http://localhost/store/public/">http://localhost/store/public/</a> . Or you may need to edit the layout script and give the exact path . If you are not conviced, then may want to get a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">sample chapter of the book</a> The book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” is available in e-book and hardcopy . Consider <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">buying a hardcopy than an e-book</a> , for its hard to sit infront of the system for a long time in the same position ( after all its upto you ). I would like to express my sincere thanks to each and every one behind Zend Framework, and to all behind Packt publishers for giving me a chance to write a review for the book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” . Would like to Thank each and every one ( bloggers ) who has helped me directly or indirectly .  <strong>Updated ( Not about the book )</strong>: If you have any doubts regarding how zend framework will help you, then its not late you can also join the Zend conference( <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">http://www.zendcon.com/</a> or follow in twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/zendcon">http://twitter.com/zendcon</a> ) and learn more about the ZF and brush up your PHP skills  . Ah I forget the name of the site where I was in a few days back ( You can see the link from <a href="http://weierophinney.net">http://weierophinney.net</a> aaah here it comes for you <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/so-its-your-first-conference">http://caseysoftware.com/blog/so-its-your-first-conference</a> ) . It really tells you about the conference and it will really help you, if you are new to the Zend conference .  You can see lots of speakers who have contibuted much to the opensource. Also the post makes you remember , that you may be a fan of some one and don&rsquo;t get over excited . Its not just a talk about ZF, but the great frameworks ( like symfony , cake etc , phpunit testing ) and future of PHP . So if you have some $$ to spend , go and be there . Hope I am not so late to point about this . Anyway enjoy the sessions and I will read from your blogs how it went . Looking forward to see nice posts .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got some request from some people asking how to configure / install zendframework 1.9 . Though its easy to do, I thought of writing it as some one who is lookingmay get some help . If you are new configuring PHP consider installing LAMP , WAMP or XAMPP . XAMPP comes with zend framework . So no need to do much work . If you in GNU/Linux you can go and get php , apache , mysql , phpmyadmin through synaptic or mannually download and configure it .  1 ) I hope you have the server LAMP or WAMP or MAMP is ready and running .  2 ) If you are using GNU/Linux use the command locate php.ini file , windows guys search it , you don&rsquo;t need commands right ?  Open it in your editor . GNU/Linux guys can do in vim or gedit . Search for the keyword include_path and add your zend framework location . I assume it as /var/ZendFramework/library . You can place anywhere and its not a big deal .  ; UNIX: &ldquo;/path1:/path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.:/usr/share/php&rdquo; include_path = &ldquo;.:/var/ZendFramework/library&rdquo; ; ; Windows: &ldquo;\path1;\path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.;c:\php\includes&rdquo;  As I am from GNU/Linux I uncommented the line and added the path where the zendframework library is located . Windows guys can add your folder path to zendframework library .  3 ) Now you have done . If you need the zf command , then you have to do some more .  Make a symbolic link and place in the /bin . That is # ln -s /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh /bin/zf  If you are in windows you need to add environment variables ( Right click on My computer &ndash; > Properties &ndash;> Settings tab ( I think ) Don&rsquo;t ask me more about it , you may need to google search. Search for adding environment variables in java , as the process is same ) . So will be easy to run command from any where as # zf &lt;command> . Else you may need to give the full path where zendframework is placed. Like  /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh or c:\ZendFramework\bin\zf.bat if you are in windows . ( Hope you have zendframework in c drive ) .  Now its ready to use your zendframework 1.9 for your projects . You have successfully installed and configured your Zendframework 1.9 . Any trouble in GNU/Linux let me know . I will help you configuring it .  *Note : You must be root and must restart apache after you have done completely .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tweet Deck was the one I used as many of them fails to connect to twitter . It was available for free download , but don&rsquo;t think is an opensource product. Today I was looking for some opensource microblogging client . Wow lol I have already installed it, then why I have not tried it before ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008444565/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/4008444565_e3718e1969.jpg" alt="Gwibber Opensource micro blogging client" /></a>  Thought of trying Gwibber . Wow its pretty cool to see . I loved the appearance . First impression is the best impression <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Its developed in Python and suppots many of the opensocial networking sites like twitter , facebook , Jaiku, Identi.ca, Flickr, Digg, and RSS. If you are an ubuntu user then you can go and get it through synaptic package manager . The Gwibber has two tabs , one to show all the tweets appearing whom we follow and the other the replies to us . Hope you too will enjoy tweeting with Gwibber . You can get it from <a href="https://launchpad.net/gwibber">https://launchpad.net/gwibber</a> .At present its not supporting Windows, don&rsquo;t know but may come in the future , and its not a big deal for opensource lovers .  Don&rsquo;t know every one faces the same problem. Sometimes gwibber fails to load the twitter feeds . I thought of looking for an alternative for gwibber . Found choqok something similar to tweet deck. Don&rsquo;t know how tweet deck looks now .. But it was having a similar look when I first installed . You can see from the screenshot how it looks .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4299005571/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4299005571_fc17342920.jpg" alt="twitter microblogging client for GNU/Linux" /></a>  You can reply , retweet , mark favourite , delete etc . It looks really awesome and currently supports twitter and identi.ca . May come with more support for others like facebook. <del>The missing feature I feel in choqok is auto shortening of url</del> . Gwibber comes with many short url services . <del>I dinot find an option to follow a person from itself for both like the one in tweetdeck</del>. Sorry auto shortening is there . Goto Settings->Configure choqok , url shortening tab , tick shorten urls on paste and select one auto shortening service. There is option to follow the person too. Also have noticed that when you point on the short url , the real url is shown in an alt, which is pretty good ( trust and security ). So bye for now . Enjoy tweets .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently in googles blog , it has published a new tool called Google Builder , which is used to create a threee dimensional model for everything built on earth . Google describes builder as a game , but the others say its a tool .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008305011/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/4008305011_253151fe7d.jpg" alt="Builder not for you GNU/Linux users" /></a>  These are some of the things that the blog says we must be aware,  1 ) Builder maker is entirely a browser based and the list contains my favourite browser Firefox too .  2 ) You need to signup before you start the application .  3 ) Google Sketchup a free 3D modelling tool will help you edit and modify.  and some more things like this . You can read more about it from <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html</a> .  I was little curious and thought ( let me experiment my skills ) of trying it as its an online free tool.  But I this time too I am disappointed . Both the tools google sketup and google builder will support Windows and Mac . Its not supporting the powerful operating system GNU/Linux . I don&rsquo;t know how come we can call it as a browser based tool as once the isro says the map of isro is a browser based one . I can call it now as an Operating System dependent tool only till it can support every Operating Systems without installing additional softwares .  I am waiting for the release of the Google Chrome OS , so I hope the new tools will defnitely support GNU / Linux operating system .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2509/4005823080_2cddac3e94_m.jpg" alt="Secure network" />After the session by Manu Zacharia ( An ISO 27001-2005 lead auditor , Director Information Security &hellip; ) from Barcamp 6, I thought of looking closely my system and who all are trying to get into the system. Yes, he was correct . We can see the attempts from different IP&rsquo;s and I just looked to get the details of the IP address .  Many of the IP&rsquo;s which where in the events blocked where from New Delhi and the ISP was BSNL . I don&rsquo;t even know whether these guys are crackers or not . Some of the IP&rsquo;s that where reported in the blocked events where from Singapore too .( Not looked all the IP details and events ).  I was wondering about the case of common people who don&rsquo;t know much about the problems and attacks like this . Is their network secure ? Even though there is good administrators , the many portals are cracked. So guys, go for open-source products , so the code is open and you can check , rather than getting a free or shareware softwares and asking a cracker to enter in your system . Be secured with some great firewall .  Don&rsquo;t go for a properitery firewall, go for opensource . Once again I am remembering you . I am planning to learn something about the security system , so that it will help me in the webdevelopment to make it much more secure than what I know now. I think every coder must learn how attacks are happening than just writing some code for money, so can make the things much more secure. We all know about XSS attack and many sites are being attacked each day now too. Why its so ? Is the coder aware how to secure it ? Yes the first thing is to learn about the attack and how its happening and then we have to stop anymore attacks like it in the future. So according to me, I think a coder must learn about security systems.</p>
