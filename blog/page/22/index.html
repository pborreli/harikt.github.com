  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have thought how you can manage your bookmarks , when logging from different systems . It was a tedious job for me to manage my bookmarks. But when I installed and know more about Foxmarks it makes my work easy . I used to login from my lap and desktop . But foxmarks make my book marks synchronize. Thanks to them .  Now lets compare some <strong>features of Foxmarks and the new Xmarks</strong>     Backup &amp; Restore : Never lose a bookmark again. Foxmarks backs up your bookmarks every time you make changes. View and restore your old bookmarks on our web site.    Web Access : Away from your computers? View, add, edit and delete your bookmarks on our website.

Simply move your mouse over the site info icon to learn more about that site. But I am sad to say you I didn&rsquo;t notice this feature . May be a bug ?  *Courtesy Foxmarks and Xamrks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you own a website , you may be interested to know more about your visitors , how they are interacting and all isnt ? When I started my site I was eager to know about it , and I found google analytics as a wonderful one. Yes , they will track all the details of the visitors. Their browser , operating system , location and much more &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  Now you dont want to write code for it . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The webanalytics is a good feature that I have seen for the website owners. You need only a gmail account and a you will receive a piece of code when adding your site. Add this code to the end of </body \> tag of your html. Yes , then you dont want to worry aboutany &hellip;..  But some days before I found another Opensource webanalytics , the piwik. I lost my previous post , which contains the old name . But if I get it I will publish. Let me say whats new in Piwik     When you are just interested to know the visitors overview without much efforts like installing piwik in your server I recommend you to go for Google Webanalytics. If you are a webdeveloper or interested to know how its working or would like to show your visitors your online website traffic , then piwik is for you .    Piwik and Google analytics do the same things . But the code of piwik is opensource and you will be having all datas on your server itself. You can add as many users and all . The piwik is a wonderful tool for webhosters . Yes , it can make a good job for them . If you are interested to know more about piwik <a href="http://piwik.org/">http://piwik.org/</a> visit the site and learn more .   </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are using a limited band width Internet then you may have thought of downloading the youtube videos to your system . Else this is not a big deal . I have searched a lot how to download youtube videos in a single click. Some doesn&rsquo;t works at all. But after a lots of search and all , one of my friend , Krissy of the phpdirector development team helped me to host one for you .  Yes, its totally free , in just simple clicks you can download youtube videos . Before that I was using the one addon with the mozilla . But adding more addons some times makes bug to the browser itself. So its not a good one I think . Its my opinion only. You can do what ever you wish .  Some of the reasons that I want to download it is for  1 ) Have a limited band width internet connection  2 ) Can watch the video even there is no internet  3 ) When the speed of internet is slow , you dont want to bother at all .  It has 3 different formats .  1 ) FLV  2 ) MP4  3 ) 3GP  If you are downloading it for mobile use 3GP . If you need a video with high quality go for mp4 .  Here is the link to <a href="http://harikt.com/youtube/" title="Download youtube videos">http://harikt.com/youtube/</a> download the videos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though I heard about open social networks, I doesn&rsquo;t gave much importance to these sites . But now I learned some facts . So was looking how I can add a digg-it , del.icio.us button in blogger. Though there are many thought of adding these two. Only successful in adding one. Working on the del.icio.us for now .  First login to your blogger account goto Settings->Archiving and look whether enable post pages is set to yes. Else make it yes and save the settings.  Then goto Layout->Edit HTML  You can download a backup. It will be good to keep your settings safe if anything goes wrong . Click Download Full Template and save it in your system.  Now you will be seeing the template in a text area . Tick Expand Widget Templates, that will add additional informations to the currently shown template in text area.  If you are using Mozilla Firefox , can quickly search for &ldquo;data:post.body&rdquo; by using ctrl + f .  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> &lt;data:post.body/> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> &lt;/div>  Add the below code above or below. Hope you have some knowledge of HTML and css .  <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg_url=&ldquo;&lt;data:post.url/>&rdquo;; &lt;/script> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> &lt;/div>  The complete code after doing so is given below.  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg_url=&ldquo;&lt;data:post.url/>&rdquo;; &lt;/script> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> &lt;/div> &lt;data:post.body/> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> &lt;/div>  Save and see the Digg in action .  You can see the Digg in action at <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com" title="Digg in action at ijust 4 u">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a>  Working on del.icio.us for now. Will add it soon after success .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Installed the captcha image validation for Joomla. Earlier I have not installed it. But some spam messages forced me to configure the captcha image developed by the waltercedric.com site.It has a wonderful wiki .  <a href="http://wiki.waltercedric.com/index.php?title=SecurityImages5.0.X">http://wiki.waltercedric.com/index.php?title=SecurityImages5.0.X</a>  Though it has one , I have to search google for some help <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/embaressed_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . These were the problems  1 ) config file not writeable  May be I am not much familiar to Joomla forced me to search for it , as I dont find a file named config. I was aware that for some file the write permission is not there. There was a trick , but it will cause security issues that I was afriad to do so ( chmod <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). Later I found the file the exact path is administrator/components/com_securityimages/config.securityimages.php . Change the mod to 777 for a while and after saving modify to 644 . Never give 777 as others can read , write and execute it. So do remember to change .  2 ) The next problem comes after it  SecurityImages patches for Joomla! are not active, is it your choice? Did you forget to deploy the patches? if no go to control panel and set &ldquo;use securityImages = true&rdquo;  I was wondering where to go as I dont see any in the control panel. It was none other than going to Global Configuration , the server tab and Use SecurityImages against spammers to Yes .  If you dont see it, then you may have not patched it. You need to upload the 14 files to the server . If done you can see the captcha in action.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to make my Joomla site work similar to a blog. Though my mind doesn&rsquo;t allow me to delete my blog in blogger , I thought of moving completely. I will not be deleting my blog , but will <del>not</del> ( Changed my mind still publishing in <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/</a> ) be publishing any more posts in blogger. I dont see a built in function for comments in Joomla. Comments help you recognise more about your posts and what others think . So installed comments feature.  I will be posting more topics in this site only , for I need to learn Joomla ( Dropped my plan, moved to Drupal <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) . Yes if you want to learn something you need to try it out. So comments is a must . I need to spent some time to configure the comments feature. Some times I have even thought of moving to Drupal , for it has some good features like that . <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I want to learn how to configure comments feature in Joomla , so I will never quit . Yes success comes to my path .  Now the comments feature is here . All can post your comments , need an account here or an open ID . The one I have installed extension for comments is mod_comment , yvcomment plugin and yvcomment module The documentation is available at <a href="http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html">http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html</a> . Its GNU/GPL . Have fun if you too need it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my friend was working with PHPMotions. Though I was aware of CMS systems , I have not thought of a Video CMS to create a youtube like clone site. I dont know why I have not thought of it still I use youtube and all ?  Anyway now I thinks about it . Yes something deep . I want to experiment with  some especially the video sections. My search starts when I start knowing about phpmotions. I searched for video cms systems. Some where nice in the demos. But all are paid softwares. Phpmotions is a freeware , but its not registered under the GNU/GPL licence. It has its own licence. But I searched for a GNU/GPL licenced one.  But my search ends when I see PHP Director . Yes we can have our own video site. Its under GPL Licence too . It has lots of features , but missing some , but in the next versions it will cover almost all that you need . I was interested to see and I would like to work on it. I will be busy with the next 2 weeks with my supplementary exams . After that I will be back , to work with the php director . They will be adding me to the developers. So in the next versions you can see some more improved features what we the phpdirector team will be introducing . I am extremely Happy to hear from them that I will be added to the team . Thanks Krissy &amp; Ben  You can see a working section of the phpdirector at <a href="http://phpdirector.harikt.com" title="PHP Director the free video CMS to your site"><strong>http://phpdirector.harikt.com</strong></a>. This is not the official demo of php director , so the contents and look may change from the real one . :) So you can download and try it , that may be better too . PHP director is at <a href="http://www.phpdirector.co.uk" title="Official site of phpdirector">http://www.phpdirector.co.uk</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Change is the law of life. When I see the quote from orkut , I have not thought much. But later I felt its something which is correct . When you do the same thing for a long time , then you feel bored. Even though you may have loved to do it.  Once I got a post by mail written by Swaroop C H , the dreamer . Yes he is a great man , I admire him . He was at Yahoo for 1 year and resigned his job, started his firm. He has written a wonderful book in Python . Its free to download the book python . So you can explore it. Its really a simple book for non programmers. Yes what I was pointing was , he has written &ldquo;Programming is fun, but when it comes to work its not so fun&rdquo;( Something like this . Don&rsquo;t remember completely ) . You can just make a google search for Swaroop CH or here is the link <a href="http://www.swaroopch.com">http://www.swaroopch.com</a>.  When you are not recognised then you will terribly bored and your temper grows . I am sure, if you have gone through these, you will recognise it.</p>
