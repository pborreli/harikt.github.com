  <div class="entry-content"><p>It may be with the introduction of Gmail many email providers makes their service free of cost , and increasing their space and features. I was having Yahoo and Gmail accounts. It was easy for me to manage emails by using filters in Yahoo. I looked for something similar in gmail.  Yes, this post is for those who don&rsquo;t know how to move the mails to a particular folder , with out keeping it in inbox. What you want to do is goto Settings tab , from top right of gmail page . Then create some labels, from the label tab . For eg : if you have subscribed for Joomla news letter , then name it as Joomla , so you can recognise quickly . Now your labels are ready . Want to create filters to move your mails directly to those labels . The labels can act something similar as folders.  Now select the Filters tab and Create a new filter . You can also edit your existing filters . When you click on the Create filter , it ask you for the From , To , subject , Has the words, Doesn&rsquo;t have . If you want an exact one, then it will be better to look the mail , for which you need to create the folder. Click show details and get the details. You can see the details there. The from address is the person who sends you the mail , the To address is the person who have mailed through some group if so , else your address or list of other peoples to whom the user sends . If you need selected terms included in that . Add to Has the words , to remove certain words , add it to doesn&rsquo;t have .  Next screen will show  Skip the Inbox (Archive it) Mark as read Star it Apply the label: Forward it to: Delete it Never send it to Spam  Tick the ones you need. skip the inbox will skip to the particular label. Now when you receive a mail from Joomla news group, then the mail will be moved to Joomla labeled one. Yes , this is pretty simple. You now can have the folders as like Yahoo .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about frameworks for more than 1 year . I was having good touch with Jose. I used to ask my doubts and he has helped me a lot. It was from his mouth I heard about framework. When he used to tell about the framework in PHP I was not much aware about , what a framework is , what it can do &hellip;&hellip;.  He used to talk about the symfony-project . When I was going for the first interview in PHP , I called Jose and Victor George one of my seniors who were working on PHP. They gave me lots of informations. Some of them were related to frameworks , MVC etc. I was really new to PHP, learning the basics, so when reading about it , I don&rsquo;t understand much. Many computer science and Information Technology guys may have heard about the commonly used buzz word OOP ( Object Oriented Programming ). When teachers used to tell us, many of us may not understand , what they are talking about. Yes, they will be telling real word many times when introducing OOP&rsquo;s concept. The OOP approach was made clear when I started learning Java. Yes we will not understand just by reading, but need to work on it, to understand the features and all. This is the same case for Framework. But when I started working on PHP , it was really a mess to write codes each and every time for new projects. So you may have thought about resusable codes. Many of you may be copying codes from one project to another. Now here comes the role of Frameworks.  If you are not planning to move to framework, then its not a big deal. Because framework are used mainly for big projects and where security to be considered. When the projects are small , frameworks may consume time. This is not what I am saying, but from the knowledge what I gained from reading. ( Updated : Working in a framework will not increase security , the coder must be aware of it <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />  ) So if you are not using frameworks , you can try the Manuel Lemo&rsquo;s form validation class. This is a great class with good examples and all. You will love the features , if you start using it. Its good for the client and server side validation . Many of the problems that arise to the forms can be rectified by this wonderful class. You can get the class from phpclasses.org .  Php classes , pear etc have a great collection of classes, which you can use and can make a small framework of your own. But what about security and all ?I too was not much aware of the security and other issues, but after exploring each day , I learned something new.  I thought of learning a framework. I was looking here and there , to get a good one. I mailed to my friends who are working in PHP to help me select a good one. Some of the PHP frameworks in the list where, symfony , zend-framework , phpcake, Yii Framework . One of my friend Rajeev is working on symfony . He told its a little bit harder to learn . But I thought of moving to symfony , as I will be getting help from my friends too <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.Not only that , but its being used in the dailymotions , delicious of yahoo . Symfony has many inbuilt functions like testing, security , model view controller etc . It may take some time , to learn symfony. The first tutorial was a wondeful one , with how much ease you can create a blog. Wow its simply superb . So if you know it properly you can build quickly .  Some of the functions are automatic admin generation , many plugins available. I was thinking after seeing the first tutorail , why I have not started learning sysmfony.  Its too late . &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. need some sleep .  Bye and Have a great day .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Internet Explorer is always a pain for developers and web designers. Many of the functions are not recognised by IE . Some people who loves the buggy browser still uses it . There are lots of features and security available in Mozilla. Don&rsquo;t know why some people still stick onto it . Aaah its upto them .  I was looking for a solution for the IE6 bug . The bug was the select box is pocking through the javascript menu . All the other elements excpet the select box will come on the top :( . I want to make it clear. Spend a lot of time to get a solution for it. Finally I was successful .  This was the solution  Need to load the menu above an iframe .Referring the site w3schools I got some helps too . We need to make the z-index of menu 1 more than that of iframe. That is when z-index of iframeis 1, z-index of menu should be 2 or more. The default z-index will be 0 . z-index -1 has lower priority . The z-index property will be availale only when position:absolute is defined for it. When position:absolute is used , there will be some design issues arrising and you need to over come these .  <iframe name="iframeblocker" id="iframeblocker" src="" style="position:absolute; z-index:1; border:0; height:200px; width:50px; top:-1000px; left:-1000px;"\>&lt;/iframe>  So we can make the iframe visible by making the changes to x, y co-ordinates. You need to make the changes through DOM .  $blocker = document.getElementById(&lsquo;iframebblocker&rsquo;);  blocker.style.left = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetLeft; // IE only  blocker.style.top = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetTop; // IE only  blocker.style.width = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetWidth;  blocker.style.height = document.getElementById(&lsquo;MenuDiv&rsquo;).offsetHeight;  The above code should be made available in the javascript menu . You can look the code where its saying to show the menu and hide. On hiding you can set the left , top , width and height to 0px. Else the iframe will be visible blocking other contents . The MenuDiv is the ID of the menu . We need to get the exact width , height , x and y c0-ordinate to show the iframe exactly below the menu . Else the iframe will be wide covering other values of the page.  Some of the features where IE specific. I have referred a lots of site , to fix this problem . Now I can handle this bug. This post is to make me remember how to solve this bug.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you own a website , you may be interested to know more about your visitors , how they are interacting and all isnt ? When I started my site I was eager to know about it , and I found google analytics as a wonderful one. Yes , they will track all the details of the visitors. Their browser , operating system , location and much more &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  Now you dont want to write code for it . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The webanalytics is a good feature that I have seen for the website owners. You need only a gmail account and a you will receive a piece of code when adding your site. Add this code to the end of </body \> tag of your html. Yes , then you dont want to worry aboutany &hellip;..  But some days before I found another Opensource webanalytics , the piwik. I lost my previous post , which contains the old name . But if I get it I will publish. Let me say whats new in Piwik     When you are just interested to know the visitors overview without much efforts like installing piwik in your server I recommend you to go for Google Webanalytics. If you are a webdeveloper or interested to know how its working or would like to show your visitors your online website traffic , then piwik is for you .    Piwik and Google analytics do the same things . But the code of piwik is opensource and you will be having all datas on your server itself. You can add as many users and all . The piwik is a wonderful tool for webhosters . Yes , it can make a good job for them . If you are interested to know more about piwik <a href="http://piwik.org/">http://piwik.org/</a> visit the site and learn more .   </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are using a limited band width Internet then you may have thought of downloading the youtube videos to your system . Else this is not a big deal . I have searched a lot how to download youtube videos in a single click. Some doesn&rsquo;t works at all. But after a lots of search and all , one of my friend , Krissy of the phpdirector development team helped me to host one for you .  Yes, its totally free , in just simple clicks you can download youtube videos . Before that I was using the one addon with the mozilla . But adding more addons some times makes bug to the browser itself. So its not a good one I think . Its my opinion only. You can do what ever you wish .  Some of the reasons that I want to download it is for  1 ) Have a limited band width internet connection  2 ) Can watch the video even there is no internet  3 ) When the speed of internet is slow , you dont want to bother at all .  It has 3 different formats .  1 ) FLV  2 ) MP4  3 ) 3GP  If you are downloading it for mobile use 3GP . If you need a video with high quality go for mp4 .  Here is the link to <a href="http://harikt.com/youtube/" title="Download youtube videos">http://harikt.com/youtube/</a> download the videos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though I heard about open social networks, I doesn&rsquo;t gave much importance to these sites . But now I learned some facts . So was looking how I can add a digg-it , del.icio.us button in blogger. Though there are many thought of adding these two. Only successful in adding one. Working on the del.icio.us for now .  First login to your blogger account goto Settings->Archiving and look whether enable post pages is set to yes. Else make it yes and save the settings.  Then goto Layout->Edit HTML  You can download a backup. It will be good to keep your settings safe if anything goes wrong . Click Download Full Template and save it in your system.  Now you will be seeing the template in a text area . Tick Expand Widget Templates, that will add additional informations to the currently shown template in text area.  If you are using Mozilla Firefox , can quickly search for &ldquo;data:post.body&rdquo; by using ctrl + f .  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> &lt;data:post.body/> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> &lt;/div>  Add the below code above or below. Hope you have some knowledge of HTML and css .  <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg_url=&ldquo;&lt;data:post.url/>&rdquo;; &lt;/script> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> &lt;/div>  The complete code after doing so is given below.  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg_url=&ldquo;&lt;data:post.url/>&rdquo;; &lt;/script> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> &lt;/div> &lt;data:post.body/> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> &lt;/div>  Save and see the Digg in action .  You can see the Digg in action at <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com" title="Digg in action at ijust 4 u">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a>  Working on del.icio.us for now.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Installed the captcha image validation for Joomla. Earlier I have not installed it. But some spam messages forced me to configure the captcha image developed by the waltercedric.com site.It has a wonderful wiki .  <a href="http://wiki.waltercedric.com/index.php?title=SecurityImages5.0.X">http://wiki.waltercedric.com/index.php?title=SecurityImages5.0.X</a>  Though it has one , I have to search google for some help <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/embaressed_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . These were the problems  1 ) config file not writeable  May be I am not much familiar to Joomla forced me to search for it , as I dont find a file named config. I was aware that for some file the write permission is not there. There was a trick , but it will cause security issues that I was afriad to do so ( chmod <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). Later I found the file the exact path is administrator/components/com_securityimages/config.securityimages.php . Change the mod to 777 for a while and after saving modify to 644 . Never give 777 as others can read , write and execute it. So do remember to change .  2 ) The next problem comes after it  SecurityImages patches for Joomla! are not active, is it your choice? Did you forget to deploy the patches? if no go to control panel and set &ldquo;use securityImages = true&rdquo;  I was wondering where to go as I dont see any in the control panel. It was none other than going to Global Configuration , the server tab and Use SecurityImages against spammers to Yes .  If you dont see it, then you may have not patched it. You need to upload the 14 files to the server . If done you can see the captcha in action.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to make my Joomla site work similar to a blog. Though my mind doesn&rsquo;t allow me to delete my blog in blogger , I thought of moving completely. I will not be deleting my blog , but will <del>not</del> ( Changed my mind still publishing in <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/</a> ) be publishing any more posts in blogger. I dont see a built in function for comments in Joomla. Comments help you recognise more about your posts and what others think . So installed comments feature.  I will be posting more topics in this site only , for I need to learn Joomla ( Dropped my plan, moved to Drupal <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) . Yes if you want to learn something you need to try it out. So comments is a must . I need to spent some time to configure the comments feature. Some times I have even thought of moving to Drupal , for it has some good features like that . <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I want to learn how to configure comments feature in Joomla , so I will never quit . Yes success comes to my path .  Now the comments feature is here . All can post your comments , need an account here or an open ID . The one I have installed extension for comments is mod_comment , yvcomment plugin and yvcomment module The documentation is available at <a href="http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html">http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html</a> . Its GNU/GPL . Have fun if you too need it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my friend was working with PHPMotions. Though I was aware of CMS systems , I have not thought of a Video CMS to create a youtube like clone site. I dont know why I have not thought of it still I use youtube and all ?  Anyway now I thinks about it . Yes something deep . I want to experiment with  some especially the video sections. My search starts when I start knowing about phpmotions. I searched for video cms systems. Some where nice in the demos. But all are paid softwares. Phpmotions is a freeware , but its not registered under the GNU/GPL licence. It has its own licence. But I searched for a GNU/GPL licenced one.  But my search ends when I see PHP Director . Yes we can have our own video site. Its under GPL Licence too . It has lots of features , but missing some , but in the next versions it will cover almost all that you need . I was interested to see and I would like to work on it. I will be busy with the next 2 weeks with my supplementary exams . After that I will be back , to work with the php director . They will be adding me to the developers. So in the next versions you can see some more improved features what we the phpdirector team will be introducing . I am extremely Happy to hear from them that I will be added to the team . Thanks Krissy &amp; Ben  You can see a working section of the phpdirector at <a href="http://phpdirector.harikt.com" title="PHP Director the free video CMS to your site"><strong>http://phpdirector.harikt.com</strong></a>. This is not the official demo of php director , so the contents and look may change from the real one . :) So you can download and try it , that may be better too . PHP director is at <a href="http://www.phpdirector.co.uk" title="Official site of phpdirector">http://www.phpdirector.co.uk</a></p>
