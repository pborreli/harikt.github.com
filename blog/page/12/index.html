It<del>s scheduled for</del> was on 20th December, 2009, Sunday at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology, Kottayam .  <del>I hope to see you guys there .</del>Hearing about barcamp for the first time ? Wiki have the answer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  This Barcamp 7 was really really interesting . If you are a techie you missed it, thats what I can say .  Some of the sessions were  1 ) Barcamp Kerala (History and Present) by Kevin Babu 2 ) 3D Computer Graphics Programming by Praseed Pai 3 ) Building complex web site the Drupal way by Fredrik Jonsson 4 ) Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech by Kenney Jacob 5 ) Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX ( by Sunil ) 6 ) Innovation! &ndash; &ldquo;The UST Global Way&rdquo; by Harikrishnan Nair 7 ) Multi Monitor Machines by Binny V A 8 ) Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan  This time my favorite one was presnted by Fredrik Jonsson &ldquo;Building complex web site the Drupal way&rdquo; . He was a person from Sweden who have came here on vaccassion. I have planned that what ever thing happens I will go to Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technlogy only because of his presntation . I love Drupal and I was interested to learn something he knows . He has already done some websites in Drupal . I got a chance to discuss with him and also Thanks for sharing his slides .If I get a picture I will keep it here .  I was little late so I didn&rsquo;t cover the presentation by Kevin Babu . Sorry the private buses from Ernakulam to Kottayam was on strike .  When I reached there Praseed Pai was the person who was speaking about the 3D Computer Graphics Programming. He just takes me to my college life . The last semester programming computer graphics . Algorithms used for drawing lines , Open GL and so on . Thanks for taking me to my college CUIET again in Barcamp .  Kenny Jacob came up with the &ldquo;Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech&rdquo; . We discussed some of the recent issues like total for you sabarinath case , love jihad issues etc .  Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX was also a great session . I think people like him are missing in the colleges. I have only some faces like him in Engineering Colleges . These type of guys are really needed in Engineering Colleges to make more professional software developers .  Innovation! &ndash; &ldquo;The UST Global Way&rdquo; by Harikrishnan Nair was a great one . He spoke about the Microsoft share point which the UST uses . He was poiting Microsoft guys called them and they were having a webinar with them . I have a chit chat with him , and he appreciated us for conducting these type of events .  I was hearing about the Multi Monitor Machines for the first time from my client, then from Eric of devzone and now I know Binny V A is using one . He invited us to his home to see the working demo. I am interested to visit and see a live session. So Binny you can expect me at any time <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan was a good one . I can see more systems coming to Barcamps are with Ubuntu . Great to see that open-source and GNU/Linux and all are changing the world .  And finally we have a talk about the entrepreneur ship and the freelancing, which was not included in the session . Some of them came with their models . One of the father came and told about his experience learning and working and building the organisation . I loved his speech and that was really awesome . He invited us for the BCK8 at his college premises . Thanks to him for the offer . Hoping to see you on BCK8 there .  Forgot to tell you that we celebrated the Christmas by cutting a cake by Fredrik Jonsson our guest for the BCK7 . Let me celebrate this Christmas with the moments from Barcamp Kerala 7 . I hope every one who was there enjoyed . During the return also I enjoyed with the barcamp guys . Thanks for the lift also Mr Dileep .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I don&rsquo;t want any one to introduce about Netbeans . When I started my mini project in Java I was using notepad, vim etc . I was not aware about the IDE&rsquo;s like Eclipse , Netbeans etc . Jose Antony was the person who introduced me wonderful IDE netbeans. Thanks to him .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4190704958/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2558/4190704958_c5cb8a4d2d.jpg" alt="Get Tomorrow Today with Netbeans IDE" /></a>  I started using Netbeans for developing some of my Java applications . Below is an in introductory video of Netbeans 6.8 , feel free to watch it .  When I moved to PHP Netbeans started supporting PHP too . The lastest version of Netbeans 6.8 comes with support for the symfony and zend framework ( Get more information from the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/zend_framework_support_added">blog of sun microsystems</a> ) . If you have not used an IDE , you may not know the power of an IDE . But the thing is that you will forget many of the keywords <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . For example a ctrl + space gives lots of methods and members of the particular class . So when some one ask you , you may say aah I don&rsquo;t remember it, I want to look into it . Thats the problem with an IDE . If you are using vim , you will never forget the methods and names, for you don&rsquo;t have enough time to look the class and get the necessary information .  Netbeans supports many dynamic languages like Java , PHP , Ruby , C++ etc . Netbeans is an opensource IDE and its totally free . I started using Netbeans after I got a free CD from netbeans team previously . I don&rsquo;t want to avoid netbeans as I love it . So get your <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/">free copy of the popular opensource IDE</a> . The caption for the Netbeans 6.8 is also interesting I loved it &ldquo;Get Tomorrow Today&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I downloaded the Google chromium OS from google . I was having some trouble configuring my Ubuntu 9.04 with virtualbox ( Not the bug of virtual box or Ubuntu , it was my fault <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). Downloaded Karmic Kola ( Ubuntu 9.10 ) and installed from USB . You can see my <a href="http://harikt.com/gnu-linux-and-open-source/43-booting-gnewsense-gnulinux-from-usb">previous post how to create USB from image</a> . The newer versions of Ubuntu rocks . Anyone needs it , just get in touch with me .  Now I downloaded the google chromium virtual box image from techcrunch ( I thought not to reinvent the google chromium virtual box image ) . If you want to try chromium you can go and get the image from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/guide-install-google-chrome-os/">techcrunch</a> and the post demonstrates each and every step very clearly .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602164/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4140602164_a141143b1c.jpg" alt="Login screen of chromium" /></a>  Login Screen  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602332/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2514/4140602332_714550bd56.jpg" alt="Signing in to chromium OS" /></a>  Signing Hari K T to chromium OS  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602434/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2673/4140602434_209bd9f9ec.jpg" alt="Chromium Desktop" /></a>  Chromium Desktop  As google says everything is online . You may not be able to login to Chromium if you are not connected to Internet . I have not read the future plans of the chromium OS . But I have some suggestions .  1 ) Chromium may need a facility to go offline too .  I hope my first point is very clear . We must be able to login to chromium when there is no internet connection too .  2 ) Office , a one like open-office ( a tool similar to microsoft office, not properitery but free and opensource <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  Google is using google docs which is also an online tool . We may need a facility to use google docs even we are offline . ie saving somthing in an xml format or what ever the good format is in our hard disk and synchronising after we go online .  3 ) Todo list  I was very Happy to see the todo list . But it seems its only available for the google team . Its not for us <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But it may be good if we ( chromium users ) too get a todo list from google . Although google calendar is there .  And everything that you see in the google chromium list are online tools . So we need offline facility too . Hope google chrome OS will come with it , also  gtalk ( with voice support ) .  If I have missed any let me know .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of you may have already heard about the movie search feature of google .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116447151/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2763/4116447151_1bd2c1e29c.jpg" alt="Google search for movies and theatere" /></a>  Now you can search location and know the running movies in each location . You will get the time and which movie is playing in the theatere . Seems an interesting one .  There is also one more interesting thing , if you are looking to create website in google pages new templates are available . So check it out and create your webpages for free .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have combined the basic things that are needed when you are developing a website using zend framework . Not included the zend framework library . This zfbase contains an admin module and a default module ( <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com">Nick Belhomme</a> technique <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  It also uses the <a href="http://amazium.be/">amazium blog</a> technique ( Jeroen Keppens ) to load the different layout for admin and front page .  If you need to connect to a db just uncomment the line in the application.ini of config directory and give the necessary details . This was a technique I learned from Rob Allen author of the book &ldquo;zend framework in action&rdquo; , zend framework educaton advisory board member and owner of the site <a href="http://akrabat.com">akrabat</a> .  I hope these files can be just copied to start another project . You don&rsquo;t want to issue the command zf create project <project name\> any more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . You can still use zf command to generate contollers and actions . Many of you may be having your own zend framework skelton . This is for those who don&rsquo;t have one and who is looking to learn how module , layout etc works in zend framework .  The zfbase skelton contains an admin module where you can place admin models and controllers . Default module the same as that of quickstart , not having any difference . So this will help newbie to zend-framework . You don&rsquo;t need to spend any more time googling . All you need is to get this and start your zend framework project .  There are many techniques , this is one way that you can do it . If you have some other nice way share and let others learn that technique too .  Tweet ( #zfbase , tinyurl : <a href="http://bit.ly/1y5me" title="http://bit.ly/1y5me">http://bit.ly/1y5me</a> ) this if you liked it . Don&rsquo;t forget to <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/zend_framework_skelton_for_newbies_to_start_your.html">promote this link in dzone</a> . You don&rsquo;t want to pay anything for writing comments , then why are you waiting ?.  Thanks to zend framework and all zend framework bloggers who are helping . I don&rsquo;t have any copy-right all rights to respective owners <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Get it from github <a href="http://github.com/harikt/zfbase">http://github.com/harikt/zfbase</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been looking the traffic rank of my website in alexa . But before the blog post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">blog tutorial using zend framework</a> , it was far away <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . You cannot think the number .  But now I am happy as I am below 10 lakhs . I don&rsquo;t really know how its working , because we are not placing any javascript or anything in our site for alexa to crawl. If its google then I can say its with the google webmaster tools .  I am very happy to see even though harikt.com is not in the hundreds or thousands . I wonder how much bandwidth is consumed for the sites in the top list . Even my site consumes a huge bandwidth .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116300059/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/4116300059_698808b5b1.jpg" alt="About the article in phpdeveloper.org" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116294515/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2750/4116294515_490f33347b.jpg" alt="Article in devzone" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116260005/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4116260005_00795e500a.jpg" alt="Home page of framework.zend.com" /></a>  Thanks especially to phpdeveloper.org ,  devzone.zend.com for publishing my post about developing a <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">simple blog application using zend framework</a> and making such a huge hits , also to zend for keeping in the home page .</p>

The bug hunt is on Thursday and Friday, 19-20 November 2009 every one can join .  I was not previously logging to #zftalk or #zftalk.dev irc channels . But seeing the post by <a href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/423-A-Guide-To-Zend-Framework-Bug-Hunt-Days.html">Padraic</a> I was interested to look into it . I added the chatzilla addon of mozilla firefox and logged in to the irc channels .  Yes it was my first experince in an irc ( though I have been hearing about irc for a long time ) . I am not a master in Zend framework , but I would love to sign a CLA ( Contributor License Agreement ) , for the points that Padraic points out . If I have not read about the post I may not have thought of signing a CLA too .  If you are using Zend framework , then you too can help to grow the zend framework . Please do read the post by Padraic .  Thanks once again to all . ( Image credits to Google ( labeled to reuse from <a href="http://frank.itlab.us">http://frank.itlab.us</a> ) )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys agian I got a chance to review the book titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-6-content-administration/book">Drupal 6 Content Administration</a>&rdquo; by J. Ayen Green published by Packt Publisher . ( The other one was <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a> by Keith Pope a wonderful book to learn Zend framework ) . If you have not heard about drupal before , the best example to show you is this website . Yes harikt.com is running on drupal , the powerful content management system ( CMS ) .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113837029/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2541/4113837029_df883e1615.jpg" alt="Drupal 6 Content Administration by Packt" /></a>  Drupal is a flexible CMS than Joomla ( with my experience ) . The flexibility come with the modules like CCK , Views , WYSIWYG editor , IMCE , poor mans cron , taxonomy etc .  Let me tell you what I felt after reading the book . This is my personal review and may be wrong , but if the below thing are added it will be an advantage .  1 ) Drupal core is just below 2Mb . Doesn&rsquo;t comes with default rich text editor . But we can extend it with modules . There are a lots of powerful third party modules . The book doesn&rsquo;t help you how to install the module. ( Page 85 The process of obtaining and installing modules is beyond the scope of this book, but the URL where they can befound is given in Appendix B. )  2 ) Drupal&rsquo;s main feature with other CMS is , they have a dedicated team for testing . They fixes and alerts the drupal users about the issues . So the drupal site must be upgraded with the latest version whether its core or modules . If you have not done , your website can be cracked by any other person who knows how to do it . Data loss is a huge loss <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I didnot see a chapter dedicated for this .  3 ) If you are looking for just a blog with out much features wordpress will do it . But the power of Drupal is to run multiple websites with a single core . ie harikt.com , drupal.org can be run from a single core of drupal . You don&rsquo;t need to go and install seperate drupal core . So upgrading modules and core is so simple . The book fails to point about it .  4 ) Just installing a module will not configure the many options in Drupal . Drupal has lots of features like roles and privileages . Though the book tells about some nice modules that every drupal site uses, it fails to show completely .  So I recommend packt to check the above things that will help to make the book better . I heard that the book is doing good and I happy to hear that it helps some . But looking the above things will make it much more better . I am interested to hear from people who have read this book , whether I have written anything wrong . My personal opinion is that this book may not help a newbie to administer drupal .  In the first installation I didnot loved Drupal , but have gone for Joomla . Later I was in love with Drupal . The community is powerful which makes me close to drupal . Some people may say a image is worth better than 1000 words <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , so I personally feels videos may be good than reading a book.  I personally look <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a> , <a href="http://lullabot.com">lullabot</a> , <a href="http://acquia.com">acquia</a> , <a href="http://learnbythedrop.com/">learn by the drop</a> ( I learned many things from this website . A big Thanks to Robert Safuto ) and many bloggers. Acquia ( run by Dries Buytaert the person behind Drupal ) and Lullabot ( I am a fan of <a href="http://webchick.net/about">Angie Byron</a> who is the Drupal 7 core maintainer ) have some core drupal developers . There many other too . I love watching some of the previews of the of <a href="http://store.lullabot.com/">store.lullabot.com</a> . Lullabot has a collection of videos to learn and master drupal . You can see what others say . I hope you too will enjoy my collections .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know you may disagree with me . But let me come to the point why I ( according to a developer view point ) thought so . Every one seems to be convinced with the frameworks and beneficts of it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113996969/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2485/4081943187_5207f8e395.jpg" alt="Zend framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702198/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4082702198_0c3d4c35f1_o.png" alt="Symfony PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702058/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4082702058_69e1f84d4a_o.png" alt="Yii framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082701908/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4082701908_53bb642a72.jpg" alt="Cake PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4081942393/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4081942393_4bceb810bc.jpg" alt="Codeigniter PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="javascript:void(0"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_506c6a9e95_o.png" alt="Lithium, light weight PHP framework" /></a>;/<em>1264915123455</em>/)  Some of the most popluar open-source frameworks are the above . I am not comparing the beneficts of each framework here . Its just in the developer perspective .  I have seen that many companies are following different styles and different frameworks for developing PHP applications . Its always nice that you do what you like and you are not forced to do the same methodology .  But we PHP Developers may need to follow a single framework rather than going behind a lots of open-source PHP frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Wait wait let me tell you why . My points may not satisfy a company , but some developers may agree with me ( I hope so ).  What&rsquo;s the benifict for developers and employers ?  Do you stick on with the same firm ? Your employee may not be productive as you thought ? Need to expand your firm ?  If so you always disagrees with me and I cannot convince you why .  Else part ( So I hope you are not )  What ever may be your skills , may be a Lion in the old firm ( with X framework ) , but when you are given Y framework ( in the new firm ) you will be a Rat . Am I right ? So here comes the benefict of using a single framework by all PHP Developers . You are the same Lion , and can go with the same speed , convince your skills in the short time , gain more and much more . Employers can recognise and get good quality coders easily. Rapid productivity from newly hired employee.  Previously Zend was not invloved developing a framework . But now they are with the open-source <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">zend framework</a> ( I think from 2007 onwards ) . Zend is the PHP company and as many frameworks are utilizing the components of Zend framework . We php developers may need to follow <del>zend only</del> one of these open-source frameworks ( After trying some of the open-source php frameworks I think we don&rsquo;t want to stick with single framework <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , but to stick with any of the popular opensource framework . You can <a href="http://harikt.com/content/benefits-open-source-frameworks-over-custom-frameworks">read the post beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom framework</a> ). Zend framework is flexible to integrate on custom frameworks . For those who love to stick on with their custom framework and wants some additional functionalities especially some of the webservices, it may be good to follow zend framework . The documentation of zend frameworks seems to be improved.  I am more attracted with <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony-project</a> for the command line features, auto generation of codes, good documentation than zend , great community. Projects like delicious, dailymotion etc are using it. Enterprise like yahoo uses it. Also we can integrate Zend components inside symfony . Fabien Potencier core developer of symfony , Matthew Weier O&#8217;Phinney lead developer of zend framework gives talks on integrating these two frameworks Symfony and Zend Framework. You can learn symfony from the symony paris 2010 on february 15 to 17. More information can be obtained from <a href="http://www.symfony-live.com/">http://www.symfony-live.com/</a>. And the good thing is Symfony 2 revealed . If you are in Paris don&rsquo;t miss this . I would have been there if I was richer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But one day I will be there to see your talk and live presentation.  Many new php frameworks are born, Lithium project seems the latest one . Lithium works only for PHP version greater than 5.3 and is under development . If you love to start working with 5.3 it may be good to make your hands dirty jumping to Lithium . The core developers are from the old cake php framework. They started this project from scratch, so they know what good and bad is . So I am sure that Lithium will be growing much more faster. You can <a href="http://harikt.com/node/120">read something about Lithium and Kohana here</a> .  Conclusion : Though I thought we php developers need a single framework , I changed my mind.  1 ) For loose components, follow Zend  2 ) Jumping to MVC to make your hands dirty for the first time ? Follow symfony , codeignitter , cake  3 ) PHP frameworks that supports PHP version 5.3 and up : lithium , symfony 2  4 ) Need some training ? symfony, cake , zend  5 ) Supporting only PHP version 5.x and up ? : Kohana , Zend , Symfony , Lithium  6 ) Still sticking with the dirty PHP 4 ? codeignitter, cake  There are lots of comparisons available. After trying some of these, I think its good to learn symfony if you are new to MVC and looking for a framework. If you are looking for a library you can go for zend.

There may be posts telling the drawbacks and beneficts of each framework .</p>
