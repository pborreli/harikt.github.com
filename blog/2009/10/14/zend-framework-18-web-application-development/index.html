<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008823767/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4008823767_bf58143231.jpg" alt="Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" /></a>   Hi guys , I got a chance to review the book &ldquo;Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development&rdquo; by Keith Pope published by Packt. I was glad to hear that they have choosen me as one of the reviewer . Let me tell you something how I came to review the book and my experience in Zendframework . After completing my Btech from Calicut University Institute of Engineering and Technology ( CUIET ) joined ISPG technologies Cochin as PHP developer from November 2007, and was interested to learn one of the frameworks like symfony , cake , codeignitter , zf , yii . It was my client Christopher Van Ittersum of Design customs who pushed me to learn ZF .     I started learning ZF after more than 1.5 years of experience developing web applications with PHP. Developed a simple blog using ZF and posted it here which was later published in devzone ( <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/9755-A-simple-blog-with-Zend-Framework-1.9">http://devzone.zend.com/article/9755-A-simple-blog-with-Zend-Framework-1.9</a> ) pushes me to write a review for “<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a>” by Keith Pope . <strong>Introduction/summary:</strong>     <a href="http://zend.com">Zend</a> “The PHP company” who is behind <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend framework</a> ( ZF ) is one of the fastest growing opensource PHP frameworks . This book is for those who know PHP and want to learn ZF or use the components . ( If you are a newbie to MVC then its like jumping to sea without a life jacket , so this book is a jacket ) . When I started reading the book I started loving it and I hope you too will defnitely love reading it. <strong>What’s the book about?</strong> The “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” book is really useful for those who want to learn Zend framework or who wants to use the ZF library in their projects . You must have some knowledge about PHP and OOP. It teaches you the mostly used zendframework components and thus improving your knowledge and shortening the learning curve. <strong>Does it achieve its promises?</strong> I was new to ZF and MVC, so I hope every like me have the same views . Many people says ZF has great docs and is easy to learn . According to me, the curve is steep , but once you learned it , you will be comfortable in it . So to climb up you need a ladder . This book is a ladder for you to learn ZF which will shorten your learning cure . It starts with a small “Hello world” application which uses the zf commands like the one used by quickstart and explains each and every details. When the book was written ( according to the author) , the command zf create module <module name\> was not available and he has created modules folder manually and so the cart doesn&rsquo;t use the zf commands. But the structure is same. The module is the one everyone new to ZF will try to learn like the database connection . This book uses some modules , so it will help you to learn about module structure . The other toughest part every person searching will the Zend_Acl and Zend_Auth which is also covered . You can learn some about unit testing with phpunit and debugging with xdebug . The book covers how to install and configure these . You will learn some of the techniques to beautify a form using the Zend_Form , also how to make pretty urls.  First I thought of writing a small comparison, after downloading the source code from Manning ( &ldquo;Zend framework in Action&rdquo; by Rob Allen of <a href="http://akrabat.com">http://akrabat.com</a> ) and Packt , but later thought of leaving it ( cannot compare 1.6 with 1.8 ). If you are interested you can try it out . According to me the Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development will really help you reducing the learning curve as its having a good example as shopping cart . <strong>Conclusion :</strong> The book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” will really help you learning ZF in a better way. Every book , has its own limitations as when the book is ready to release many new features will be introduced and some features will be deprecated. Also writing a blog post itself is tedious job , so what about writing a book ? He has tried to help you learn ZF very well without much mistakes . So the book is not the last step to learn ZF, but will help you learn zend framework quickly. The one thing I have noticed working with the example was you need to configure virtual host else the style sheets will not be taken . ie <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> and have some trouble with <a href="http://localhost/store/public/">http://localhost/store/public/</a> . Or you may need to edit the layout script and give the exact path . If you are not conviced, then may want to get a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">sample chapter of the book</a> The book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” is available in e-book and hardcopy . Consider <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">buying a hardcopy than an e-book</a> , for its hard to sit infront of the system for a long time in the same position ( after all its upto you ). I would like to express my sincere thanks to each and every one behind Zend Framework, and to all behind Packt publishers for giving me a chance to write a review for the book “Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development” . Would like to Thank each and every one ( bloggers ) who has helped me directly or indirectly .  <strong>Updated ( Not about the book )</strong>: If you have any doubts regarding how zend framework will help you, then its not late you can also join the Zend conference( <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">http://www.zendcon.com/</a> or follow in twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/zendcon">http://twitter.com/zendcon</a> ) and learn more about the ZF and brush up your PHP skills  . Ah I forget the name of the site where I was in a few days back ( You can see the link from <a href="http://weierophinney.net">http://weierophinney.net</a> aaah here it comes for you <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/so-its-your-first-conference">http://caseysoftware.com/blog/so-its-your-first-conference</a> ) . It really tells you about the conference and it will really help you, if you are new to the Zend conference .  You can see lots of speakers who have contibuted much to the opensource. Also the post makes you remember , that you may be a fan of some one and don&rsquo;t get over excited . Its not just a talk about ZF, but the great frameworks ( like symfony , cake etc , phpunit testing ) and future of PHP . So if you have some $$ to spend , go and be there . Hope I am not so late to point about this . Anyway enjoy the sessions and I will read from your blogs how it went . Looking forward to see nice posts .</p>
