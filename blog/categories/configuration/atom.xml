    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got some request from some people asking how to configure / install zendframework 1.9 . Though its easy to do, I thought of writing it as some one who is lookingmay get some help . If you are new configuring PHP consider installing LAMP , WAMP or XAMPP . XAMPP comes with zend framework . So no need to do much work . If you in GNU/Linux you can go and get php , apache , mysql , phpmyadmin through synaptic or mannually download and configure it .  1 ) I hope you have the server LAMP or WAMP or MAMP is ready and running .  2 ) If you are using GNU/Linux use the command locate php.ini file , windows guys search it , you don&rsquo;t need commands right ?  Open it in your editor . GNU/Linux guys can do in vim or gedit . Search for the keyword include_path and add your zend framework location . I assume it as /var/ZendFramework/library . You can place anywhere and its not a big deal .  ; UNIX: &ldquo;/path1:/path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.:/usr/share/php&rdquo; include_path = &ldquo;.:/var/ZendFramework/library&rdquo; ; ; Windows: &ldquo;\path1;\path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.;c:\php\includes&rdquo;  As I am from GNU/Linux I uncommented the line and added the path where the zendframework library is located . Windows guys can add your folder path to zendframework library .  3 ) Now you have done . If you need the zf command , then you have to do some more .  Make a symbolic link and place in the /bin . That is # ln -s /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh /bin/zf  If you are in windows you need to add environment variables ( Right click on My computer &ndash; > Properties &ndash;> Settings tab ( I think ) Don&rsquo;t ask me more about it , you may need to google search. Search for adding environment variables in java , as the process is same ) . So will be easy to run command from any where as # zf &lt;command> . Else you may need to give the full path where zendframework is placed. Like  /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh or c:\ZendFramework\bin\zf.bat if you are in windows . ( Hope you have zendframework in c drive ) .  Now its ready to use your zendframework 1.9 for your projects . You have successfully installed and configured your Zendframework 1.9 . Any trouble in GNU/Linux let me know . I will help you configuring it .  *Note : You must be root and must restart apache after you have done completely .</p>
