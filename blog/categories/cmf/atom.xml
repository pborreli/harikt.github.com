    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>May be the question is so simple for you. But many times I feel it much complicated. Everyone would have started their website with a custom cms and later moved to Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or something similar. I used to look for a better book in any language which has design decisions made for the cms to make it such a way that it can be extended. Some of the books that seems interesting to me are 1 ) <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430218791">Pro Zend Framework CMS</a> 2 ) <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition/book">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a> It will be great to see if you have came across such books or do you recommend any other books. I am not just looking for PHP, but I am interested to read any sort of books, which will help me to build the next blogger. Waiting to hear you suggestions on the same.</p>
