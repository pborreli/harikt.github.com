    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://processwire.com/">Processwire</a> is a content management framework.</p>

<p>I was looking to change the directory structure of the Processwire.</p>

<p><code>bash
|-- index.php
|-- installer.php
|-- README.md
|-- site
`-- wire
</code></p>

<p>I am not the first person to talk on the subject. There are other threads
like
<a href="http://processwire.com/talk/topic/876-installation-paths-and-moving-folders/">Installation paths and moving folders</a>,
<a href="http://processwire.com/talk/topic/3445-common-practices/">Common practices</a></p>

<p>Anyway I thought of trying the same and for serving the <code>js</code>, <code>css</code>, <code>images</code>
I wrote my first processwire module <a href="https://github.com/harikt/Assets">Assets</a></p>

<p>Some of the portions are from
<a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework/blob/f122f77b7f97d3bec9dbf930a66e706d2b89b6f8/src/Aura/Framework/Web/Asset/Page.php#L123-L147">Aura.Framework</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/blob/613286b1122bd7ef78a12550afdb10f78813d040/src/Aura/View/FormatTypes.php#L31-L113">Aura.View</a></p>

<p><code>``bash
|-- cli
|-- composer.json
|-- index.php ( which is moved to web folder )
|-- installer.php
|-- README.md
|-- site
|   |-- assets
|   |-- config.php
|   |-- hello.css
|   |-- install
|   |-- modules
|  </code>&mdash; templates
|&mdash; vendor (3rd party vendors from PHP, Eg: Aura.Includer )
|&mdash; httpdocs ( you can name this folder what ever you like )
|   |&mdash; index.php
|   |&mdash; site ( css, js and images copied from realpath )
|   <code>-- wire ( css, js and images copied from realpath )
</code>&mdash; wire</p>

<pre><code>|-- config.php
|-- core
|-- index.config.php
|-- modules
|-- README.txt
`-- templates-admin
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You also need to change the <code>$rootPath</code> in <code>index.php</code> accordingly.
Hope someone will find it useful.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have combined the basic things that are needed when you are developing a website using zend framework . Not included the zend framework library . This zfbase contains an admin module and a default module ( <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com">Nick Belhomme</a> technique <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  It also uses the <a href="http://amazium.be/">amazium blog</a> technique ( Jeroen Keppens ) to load the different layout for admin and front page .  If you need to connect to a db just uncomment the line in the application.ini of config directory and give the necessary details . This was a technique I learned from Rob Allen author of the book &ldquo;zend framework in action&rdquo; , zend framework educaton advisory board member and owner of the site <a href="http://akrabat.com">akrabat</a> .  I hope these files can be just copied to start another project . You don&rsquo;t want to issue the command zf create project <project name\> any more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . You can still use zf command to generate contollers and actions . Many of you may be having your own zend framework skelton . This is for those who don&rsquo;t have one and who is looking to learn how module , layout etc works in zend framework .  The zfbase skelton contains an admin module where you can place admin models and controllers . Default module the same as that of quickstart , not having any difference . So this will help newbie to zend-framework . You don&rsquo;t need to spend any more time googling . All you need is to get this and start your zend framework project .  There are many techniques , this is one way that you can do it . If you have some other nice way share and let others learn that technique too .  Tweet ( #zfbase , tinyurl : <a href="http://bit.ly/1y5me" title="http://bit.ly/1y5me">http://bit.ly/1y5me</a> ) this if you liked it . Don&rsquo;t forget to <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/zend_framework_skelton_for_newbies_to_start_your.html">promote this link in dzone</a> . You don&rsquo;t want to pay anything for writing comments , then why are you waiting ?.  Thanks to zend framework and all zend framework bloggers who are helping . I don&rsquo;t have any copy-right all rights to respective owners <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .
