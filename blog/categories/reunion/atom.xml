    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing my post from Trivandrum Railway station. Was busy leaving to attend the Bar Camp Kerala event at Technopark , so was not able to write any. It was really a Happy moment when you see your old friends . We the CUIET once conducted the reunion of the 2003-2007 IT Batch of CUIET. There was only a few attended. I have never thought the reunion of the 10th standard will be such a colourful one.  Every one was having a smiling face, even in their bitter moments . The teachers were all happy to see the old students after 8 long years. Jayadevan may be one of the happiest man , as he was really thrilled to see all of us. He was at Calcutta and reached only for this get together. The event may not occur if Rajeesh Chandran have not initiated. He has done a wonderful work. So many guys came from Chennai , Bangalore , Ernakulam and also from different parts. Some of them were working and some are still studying.     <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3495904062_8fc667ed42.jpg?v=0" title="Chinmaya Vidyalaya 2000-01 Batch reunion conducted on May 2nd" alt="Chinmaya Vidyalaya 2000-01 Batch reunion conducted on May 2nd" /> You can see the smile on the faces of all. It was really a rocking day. Does any one see, any thirst for food ? Yes , we have not taken our lunch too till 2:30 PM. But smiling faces all around . Have a great day guys. Lets rock on some other day once again .  </p>
