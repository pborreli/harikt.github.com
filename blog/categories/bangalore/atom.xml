Find some documentation api and code at <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a> . See you at Barcamp Bangalore! Note : I expect you know about PHP and the new things which are already there in PHP 5.3 and 5.4 . I will not be teaching PHP for its time limited talk.

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2010/02/24/second-symfony-workshop-bangalore</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first symfony workshop was on 13th ( brought qaeet application ) and the second was conducted on 21st sunday at Techjini office Bangalore . I was one among them in the waiting list in phpmeetup, but as I attended the first meetup I got the permission to be part of the second one . I travelled around 680 Km by train ( 12 hours of journey from Ernakulam to Bangalore and vice versa ) to be part of the symfony workshop in Bangalore . I was really wondering why the guys who have RSVP ed yes didnot looked so seriously to attend it . Sjoerd De Jong also have send mails to all the users in the group about RSVP ing only if they are able to come . If the guys have RSVP ed no some others was able to be part of it. The strength was only 5 ( Elvisds called one of his friend who was interested to be part of the event ) this time ( 12 guys was unable to attend as the other 12 guys RSVP ed yes <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  Anyway the second workshop was also a wonderful one . Sjoerd&rsquo;s system broke ( lol poor windows ) and he was using my system with Ubuntu 9.10 , Netbeans 6.8 , svn and some other tools . He shows the power of symfony routing with an example , symfony admin-generator , some ajax . As I want to catch my train around 5:00 PM and some others also was leaving, Sjoerd winded up the event . But it was really an awesome one . I know my posts are becoming too late . But the thing is that I am little busy with Book reviews and all .  I have uploaded the application to github . Feel free to look into the code and learn symfony. Though I have named the application as jobeet its not the jobeet tutorial . These are some of the things that we have done on the 2nd meetup . <a href="http://github.com/harikt/jobeet">http://github.com/harikt/jobeet</a> . Sjoerd also recommends you to look Symfony 2 if you are not looking to develop a project with symfony in the short time for its really a new improved code base which will be published completely in the late 2010 . You can look into the site <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a> .  Note : A help to those who are searching or looking for Bus number from Bangalore City Railway station ( Majestic ) to J P Nagar 2nd (second ) phase, 24th Main . You can get the bus from the 11th platform and catch buses numbered 2 ( 2A , 2B etc) . The conductors will help you getting the proper place . ( This is from my past journey dated 21st Feb 2010 . Platform and bus numbers may change as time passes . So feel free to update me if any )</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may be knowing that I was at Bangalore on February 13th to be part of the symfony workshop. I was little late ( late by 10 mins ) so I didnot looked for a hotel to have my break fast . The workshop was conducted by Sjoerd De Jong at Techjini office Bangalore. We developed a qaeet application ( Though I says its we, Sjoerd was the main person who was working on that . So full credits to him ). Though the strength of the people who have RSVP was 15 , some of them didnot attended the event ( May be due to some other personal reasons , but that makes a loss for the others who wished to come #fail ) . Anyway for the 2nd meetup if you guys who have RSVP ed yes and is not able to come or have changed your mind , please make the changes in the meetup site . That will be a great help to others who love to attend the session .  We were a total of 7 guys for the workshop . 3 were from Techjini itself . One the owner itslef Amith Rana and two other employees ( Amal and Amith ) . We have a great time developing the qaeet and discussing some other nice cool applications . Techjini guys was working in symfony for a long time , so they too have helped Sjoerd when some bugs occurs . We winded the session around 5 PM .  The source code of the qaeet application is at <a href="http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet">http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet</a> . I have requested Sjoerd to add a read me file which will be a great help to quickly understand . You can also watch the <a href="http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/">http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/</a> group, some times may be having the qaeet in the future .  Updated : If you are a symfony developer you will be defnitely knowing about the release of Symfony 2 which was at Symfony Live Paris event . Now its a developer preview release ( We can see the guys are excited to see what Symfony will give you ) . Symfony 2 will be available in the late 2010 . I was watching twitter and the symfony blog and got lots of information about the Paris event just finished . Symfony 2 will be using some of the components of Zend . The slides are available and is a good resource though we missed the talk given by them . Matthew Weier O'Phinney have given a talk about how to use of Zend components in symfony project . I also loved the presentation of Dustin Whittle of Yahoo . Yahoo uses symfony as a full stack framework ( Delicious , Yahoo answers etc ) . In his slide he has shown what Rasmus think about PHP framework and the bench mark of hello world application . Yes I too agree we don&rsquo;t need a framework to write hello world . Hell with hello world bench mark for PHP frameworks .  I know every one have enjoyed the Symfony Live held in Paris . And lets wait to see the first release of Symfony 2 PHP framework in the late 2010 . Till then we can watch the symfony-reloaded.org.</p>
