    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sixth barcamp kerala which was held on Rajgiri college cochin ( RASAT ) ended with colors . The college campus of Rajgiri was a beautiful one. I just thought of my campus days at CUIET ( Nostalgic feelings ) .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4005098016/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2636/4005098016_c79bb99238.jpg" alt="Barcamp6 at Rajgiri college" /></a>  Photo credits to Kenny  It was really a colorful campus ( We cannot compare CUIET to Rajgiri , you must see both the college to understand why I am saying so ). The event was on the main building and there was a beautiful pond infront of it and some geese where swimming in it ( Awesome ) . Keeping a picture of it ( photo credits to Jins Abraham which was on the Barcamp site <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4004409621/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2672/4004409621_8607c1d308.jpg" alt="Geese in the front of Rajgiri college cochin" /></a>  There was a total of eight sessions . As I am attending Barcamp for the second time I was familiar with many of them . It was really great fun to share things and see the great guys . One of the nice talks was by Arun Basi Lal of Millionclues . Its hard to see people like Arun Basi Lal who is a studying for BTech and attending Barcamps . Many of them never looked like this events . If you are into some professional colleges , then I think you should atleast participate in events like this . I know the limitations , but it will be really useful in your future especially when you are out from college . I remember the one of the presentation in Barcamp five by Binny V A , &ldquo;What they don&rsquo;t teach you in college&rdquo; and I agree with it . Many people who came to Barcamp have achieved something only because of their hardwork . Though the event was from Rajgiri a professional college , only a few from the college where present .  Another session by Manu Zacharia of Milleninnium IT consultants was a great one about Ethical Hacking , &ldquo;Hacking in its real sense&rdquo; . The one I remember about his talk was about the 7 line shell script which make Windows 7 down . ( To the persons who are hearing the term hacking for the first time , consider looking the ietf <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2828.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2828.txt</a> for the difference between hacker and cracker ).  The Anand ( He is popularly called as The Anand ie why writte so ) introduced the concept of carpooling which must be introduced in the cities of India . Its really good to see group of people of same likes moving in a city than going single in each car . There are lots of advatages . You can think about it . Soon they may be coming with a portal .  All the remaining sessions where really interesting and finally we wrapped the event saying &ldquo;See you in the next Barcamp&rdquo; .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116483191/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4116483191_d540894cf7.jpg" alt="Barcamp 6 Kerala" /></a>  I was walking with Nithin and we took some snaps from the campus . Will upload it soon after getting those pictures . Before leaving Rajgiri we took a nice snap . Hope I will get the snaps of it soon .  Uploaded some of them to picasa .
