    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4294304881/" title="opensource_logo by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4294304881_87b173eb57_t.jpg" alt="opensource_logo" /></a>Recently I was arguing with one of my friend over the beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom . I know there may be lots of posts describing the beneficts and drawbacks . But I just thought of writing it as I can say I have written about that in my blog. You can check it out .  I hope every one knows about <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">opensource</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">licences</a> . I have been using and learning some of the most popular opensource frameworks like zend, lithium , drupal etc . So lets move on to what are the beneficts I feel .  Beneficts of open source :  1 ) Mainly community supported .  2 ) Coding standards will be followed .  3 ) Throughly tested and immediate patches will be available if any thing breaks .  4 ) Can get quick help from the community .  5 ) Flexible for maintaince ( ie not throw away prototyping )  6 ) Many do unit testing using the popular test tools like phpunit , simpletest etc .  Beneficts of custom :  1 ) Custom frameworks may be good for a developer as he knows what he has written . I don&rsquo;t think there is much beneficts for users .  Drawbacks of custom frameworks :  1 ) It will be developed by a single or some group of people.  2 ) May be tested by some group of peoples , but lacks the tests done by community ( mass of people )  3 ) Developing from scratch is not a big deal , but maintainence is the one that&rsquo;s costly than development . When its custom made , you may need to get the exact people for that . Else its like &ldquo;too many cooks spoil the broothe&rdquo;. Pretty enough community developers, so not a big deal to get one.  4 ) May or may not be flexible . For example lets compare with drupal . When you starts your project , you may have thought just a small blog , then later you thought of having forums , after that you thought you need to sell some goods.  When its drupal like framework , its easy as you just need to maintain the common code base which comes with much of the features and some other contributed and custom modules will make everything fine . But when its custom , you may need to mess with the code , or may need to go extending it , which is not so easy like drupal or any other .  These are what I feel for now . May be more points , but for the time I am not remebering it . If any one feels I missed any , please add your comments I will update it .</p>

    <updated>2009-12-22T21:14:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg" alt="kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr" /></a>I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can <a href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries">import zend framework libraries in Kohana</a> . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the <a href="http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/">tutorial of Kohana 3</a> which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5 framework" /></a>That&rsquo;s all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don&rsquo;t know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a> . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270">to codeigniter guys</a> &ldquo;Dear #CodeIgniter People, Don&rsquo;t you care that it&rsquo;s almost 2010 and you&rsquo;re still running PHP4 code? Yours, &ndash; Nate&rdquo; and he got a <a href="http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250">reply from Chris Cornutt</a> of <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> &ldquo;@nateabele it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)&rdquo; . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version <del>0.5</del> 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don&rsquo;t remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions</a> . You can see how fast its moving .</p>
