    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if you have Windows, sometimes you may be facing the same problem. You may need to check IE 6 , 7 , 8 . I used to work from GNU / Linux . But recently I came to a site which gives the live screenshots of the webpages in different operating systems with different browsers . This made me think how it works :) .  Yes its easy to implement it . You just need a Windows machine with IE6 , another with IE7 , and IE8 . So now it has 3 machines with 3 IE versions . You can either login to the other machine using the remote desktop and check the browser compatibility there .  This is also a cheapest way to reduce the cost of developement according to me . By this way every one can login to their GNU/Linux machine and login to remote desktop to test the IE versions . Windows 7 comes with some , and I have heard that there is some softwares also to make IE 6, 7, 8 work on a single machine . But I am not much aware of  the softwares as I don&rsquo;t have a Windows running in mine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I welcome any of the windows users to come and contribute to this . I will be much more happier to hear from you . You can write the comments <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> and let me know what you think .</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2009/10/13/configuring-zendframework-gnulinux-or-any/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-13T23:28:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/10/13/configuring-zendframework-gnulinux-or-any</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got some request from some people asking how to configure / install zendframework 1.9 . Though its easy to do, I thought of writing it as some one who is lookingmay get some help . If you are new configuring PHP consider installing LAMP , WAMP or XAMPP . XAMPP comes with zend framework . So no need to do much work . If you in GNU/Linux you can go and get php , apache , mysql , phpmyadmin through synaptic or mannually download and configure it .  1 ) I hope you have the server LAMP or WAMP or MAMP is ready and running .  2 ) If you are using GNU/Linux use the command locate php.ini file , windows guys search it , you don&rsquo;t need commands right ?  Open it in your editor . GNU/Linux guys can do in vim or gedit . Search for the keyword include_path and add your zend framework location . I assume it as /var/ZendFramework/library . You can place anywhere and its not a big deal .  ; UNIX: &ldquo;/path1:/path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.:/usr/share/php&rdquo; include_path = &ldquo;.:/var/ZendFramework/library&rdquo; ; ; Windows: &ldquo;\path1;\path2&rdquo; ;include_path = &ldquo;.;c:\php\includes&rdquo;  As I am from GNU/Linux I uncommented the line and added the path where the zendframework library is located . Windows guys can add your folder path to zendframework library .  3 ) Now you have done . If you need the zf command , then you have to do some more .  Make a symbolic link and place in the /bin . That is # ln -s /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh /bin/zf  If you are in windows you need to add environment variables ( Right click on My computer &ndash; > Properties &ndash;> Settings tab ( I think ) Don&rsquo;t ask me more about it , you may need to google search. Search for adding environment variables in java , as the process is same ) . So will be easy to run command from any where as # zf &lt;command> . Else you may need to give the full path where zendframework is placed. Like  /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh or c:\ZendFramework\bin\zf.bat if you are in windows . ( Hope you have zendframework in c drive ) .  Now its ready to use your zendframework 1.9 for your projects . You have successfully installed and configured your Zendframework 1.9 . Any trouble in GNU/Linux let me know . I will help you configuring it .  *Note : You must be root and must restart apache after you have done completely .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tweet Deck was the one I used as many of them fails to connect to twitter . It was available for free download , but don&rsquo;t think is an opensource product. Today I was looking for some opensource microblogging client . Wow lol I have already installed it, then why I have not tried it before ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008444565/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/4008444565_e3718e1969.jpg" alt="Gwibber Opensource micro blogging client" /></a>  Thought of trying Gwibber . Wow its pretty cool to see . I loved the appearance . First impression is the best impression <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Its developed in Python and suppots many of the opensocial networking sites like twitter , facebook , Jaiku, Identi.ca, Flickr, Digg, and RSS. If you are an ubuntu user then you can go and get it through synaptic package manager . The Gwibber has two tabs , one to show all the tweets appearing whom we follow and the other the replies to us . Hope you too will enjoy tweeting with Gwibber . You can get it from <a href="https://launchpad.net/gwibber">https://launchpad.net/gwibber</a> .At present its not supporting Windows, don&rsquo;t know but may come in the future , and its not a big deal for opensource lovers .  Don&rsquo;t know every one faces the same problem. Sometimes gwibber fails to load the twitter feeds . I thought of looking for an alternative for gwibber . Found choqok something similar to tweet deck. Don&rsquo;t know how tweet deck looks now .. But it was having a similar look when I first installed . You can see from the screenshot how it looks .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4299005571/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4299005571_fc17342920.jpg" alt="twitter microblogging client for GNU/Linux" /></a>  You can reply , retweet , mark favourite , delete etc . It looks really awesome and currently supports twitter and identi.ca . May come with more support for others like facebook. <del>The missing feature I feel in choqok is auto shortening of url</del> . Gwibber comes with many short url services . <del>I dinot find an option to follow a person from itself for both like the one in tweetdeck</del>. Sorry auto shortening is there . Goto Settings->Configure choqok , url shortening tab , tick shorten urls on paste and select one auto shortening service. There is option to follow the person too. Also have noticed that when you point on the short url , the real url is shown in an alt, which is pretty good ( trust and security ). So bye for now . Enjoy tweets .</p>

    <updated>2009-10-13T21:14:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/10/13/google-builder-and-supported-operating-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently in googles blog , it has published a new tool called Google Builder , which is used to create a threee dimensional model for everything built on earth . Google describes builder as a game , but the others say its a tool .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008305011/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/4008305011_253151fe7d.jpg" alt="Builder not for you GNU/Linux users" /></a>  These are some of the things that the blog says we must be aware,  1 ) Builder maker is entirely a browser based and the list contains my favourite browser Firefox too .  2 ) You need to signup before you start the application .  3 ) Google Sketchup a free 3D modelling tool will help you edit and modify.  and some more things like this . You can read more about it from <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html</a> .  I was little curious and thought ( let me experiment my skills ) of trying it as its an online free tool.  But I this time too I am disappointed . Both the tools google sketup and google builder will support Windows and Mac . Its not supporting the powerful operating system GNU/Linux . I don&rsquo;t know how come we can call it as a browser based tool as once the isro says the map of isro is a browser based one . I can call it now as an Operating System dependent tool only till it can support every Operating Systems without installing additional softwares .  I am waiting for the release of the Google Chrome OS , so I hope the new tools will defnitely support GNU / Linux operating system .</p>
