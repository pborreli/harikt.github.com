The dates and places are as follows  05 Dec Kochi 10 Dec Allapuzha 12 Dec Kollam 14 Dec Trivandrum 19 Dec Thrissur 21 Dec Pallakad 23 Dec Kozhikode 26 Dec Thalasery  If you are interested you can subscribe to sms channel by sending an sms with message &ldquo;on internetbus&rdquo; to 9870-807070 and get upto date .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I downloaded the Google chromium OS from google . I was having some trouble configuring my Ubuntu 9.04 with virtualbox ( Not the bug of virtual box or Ubuntu , it was my fault <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). Downloaded Karmic Kola ( Ubuntu 9.10 ) and installed from USB . You can see my <a href="http://harikt.com/gnu-linux-and-open-source/43-booting-gnewsense-gnulinux-from-usb">previous post how to create USB from image</a> . The newer versions of Ubuntu rocks . Anyone needs it , just get in touch with me .  Now I downloaded the google chromium virtual box image from techcrunch ( I thought not to reinvent the google chromium virtual box image ) . If you want to try chromium you can go and get the image from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/guide-install-google-chrome-os/">techcrunch</a> and the post demonstrates each and every step very clearly .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602164/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4140602164_a141143b1c.jpg" alt="Login screen of chromium" /></a>  Login Screen  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602332/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2514/4140602332_714550bd56.jpg" alt="Signing in to chromium OS" /></a>  Signing Hari K T to chromium OS  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602434/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2673/4140602434_209bd9f9ec.jpg" alt="Chromium Desktop" /></a>  Chromium Desktop  As google says everything is online . You may not be able to login to Chromium if you are not connected to Internet . I have not read the future plans of the chromium OS . But I have some suggestions .  1 ) Chromium may need a facility to go offline too .  I hope my first point is very clear . We must be able to login to chromium when there is no internet connection too .  2 ) Office , a one like open-office ( a tool similar to microsoft office, not properitery but free and opensource <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  Google is using google docs which is also an online tool . We may need a facility to use google docs even we are offline . ie saving somthing in an xml format or what ever the good format is in our hard disk and synchronising after we go online .  3 ) Todo list  I was very Happy to see the todo list . But it seems its only available for the google team . Its not for us <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But it may be good if we ( chromium users ) too get a todo list from google . Although google calendar is there .  And everything that you see in the google chromium list are online tools . So we need offline facility too . Hope google chrome OS will come with it , also  gtalk ( with voice support ) .  If I have missed any let me know .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/11/02/finally-i-too-got-google-wave</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long wait I too got my google wave . My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ArunBasilLal">Arun Basilal</a> got wave .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817864/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2735/4068817864_b7dac4e3c7.jpg" alt="Hari K T on google wave" /></a>  I requested him and he was ready to send me an invite and was invited on 28th October . I was waiting and waiting and google may have tested my patience . And finally today ( November 2nd ) I was telling <a href="http://twitter.com/priyanr">Priyan</a> to send me one more , as wave didn&rsquo;t reach after 48 hours .  Priyan was Happy and send me an invite . Opening gmail I was really Happy to see the the google invite from Arun Basilal of <a href="http://www.millionclues.com">Million Clues</a> . Thanks once again Priyan and Basilal .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817870/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4068817870_4986515ce4.jpg" alt="Hari K T making Google wave in action" /></a>  Not explored much in wave . I want to make experiments with it. Thanks to all and Thanks to google for making a wonderful application .  Still wondering what wave is ? Oh then the video is for you . Get inspired and rock on wave . Google wave at present needs invitation .  Hope this video made you crazy .  Updated on 07 November 2009 : After some days of using google wave I feel that google wave will not rock until every user gets one . Many are inactive for you may be having only a few people in your contacts who uses wave . So they just check wave once a day . Its a great colloborative tool, and I know that it will rocks in the future. So you guys may want to wait until you get an invite . Its always good that developers get wave invite rather than just users ;) .  11 th November 2009 : I have a very few google wave invites. If anyone is interested in it , just drop a comment . I will send it to you , if its not over . Just 8 invites are there <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So the first 8 will get it .</p>

    <updated>2009-10-13T21:14:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/10/13/google-builder-and-supported-operating-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently in googles blog , it has published a new tool called Google Builder , which is used to create a threee dimensional model for everything built on earth . Google describes builder as a game , but the others say its a tool .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008305011/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/4008305011_253151fe7d.jpg" alt="Builder not for you GNU/Linux users" /></a>  These are some of the things that the blog says we must be aware,  1 ) Builder maker is entirely a browser based and the list contains my favourite browser Firefox too .  2 ) You need to signup before you start the application .  3 ) Google Sketchup a free 3D modelling tool will help you edit and modify.  and some more things like this . You can read more about it from <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html</a> .  I was little curious and thought ( let me experiment my skills ) of trying it as its an online free tool.  But I this time too I am disappointed . Both the tools google sketup and google builder will support Windows and Mac . Its not supporting the powerful operating system GNU/Linux . I don&rsquo;t know how come we can call it as a browser based tool as once the isro says the map of isro is a browser based one . I can call it now as an Operating System dependent tool only till it can support every Operating Systems without installing additional softwares .  I am waiting for the release of the Google Chrome OS , so I hope the new tools will defnitely support GNU / Linux operating system .</p>
