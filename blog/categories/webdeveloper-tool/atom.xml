    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I still remember my old pages, got html templates for free . Downloaded and added the contents and the design was broken usually. I was not much aware of why the design breaks . My experiences teaches me a lot why its happening. I have only 1 year 5 months experience, but I when looking back I may be having more than that because of my self learning <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif" title="Laughing" alt="Laughing" /> . I think in one of my post I have expressed my Thanks to Dileep often called Dilpu , a student from NIT . He is one of the person, who makes me think and learn HTML . I used my class hours at Library to learn HTML . I was not aware of HTML , CSS or W3C or any standards of Web . So when adding contents to pages , I often fails at those times . It was just static pages . But later I learned why its happening , what W3C is what XHTML and all.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3563/3490763401_8c2b1abfc2.jpg?v=0" title="Firebug mozilla firefox addon in action" alt="Firebug mozilla firefox addon in action" />  These were only to static HTML. When I started my profession I was eager to learn more and found Firebug a mozilla firefox add-on once . Installed it just to try , as its all free and open source projects . Firebug may be one of the easy tool that can be used to fix the design issues. When the designers convert to XHTML , some of them uses fixed width . But in dynamic pages , the height often changes and it may be a mess to fid out whats the problem .So here comes the role of firebug . You can view the properties for each of the tag . So you can recognise which all are inherited and all . So its easy to fix issues arising to font&rsquo;s and all . I think Firebug was introduced when I was looking the carrers in Mozilla <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . They are looking people who are familiar in firebug, that forced me to install firebug . Now I know why they are looking for people who uses firebug . Great guys .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a web developer or a server admin always communicating to download / upload files, then the Fire FTP is a wonderful addon for the Mozilla Firefox. Some times you may not be having enough permission to install the software . Then you may be trying to contact admin or some one to get it. But don&rsquo;t ask any body . Go and get the addon for Mozilla Firefox. Yes, its pretty easy and is a wonderful one . You may love to use it from the browser itself. FTP in one tab and the remaining pages in another .
