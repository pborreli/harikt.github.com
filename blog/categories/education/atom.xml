    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of you know why education is needed ? Whats the value of education in life ?  According to me , education does'nt means only knowledge gained from an institution or getting a degree . Its making a person as a human . Many of you may disagree with me . I have found many people who have a PHD even fails to recognise human <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  A best example I can show you that many of the Keralites are still not educated is many people strikes against the introduction of a chapter &ldquo;മതം ഇല്ലാത ജീവന്‍ &rdquo; in the 7th standard. I don&rsquo;t know why every one complains about the chapter . India is a country rich with many religions , that may be the unity of India too . Look our neighbours Pakisthan , Bangladesh and all . Do you want a country like that ?  I don&rsquo;t know who my Ancestor&rsquo;s is . You may be knowing upto your grand father . A man is born without  a religion or caste . But when they grow they are quarelling on the basis of caste and religion . I remember the old song &ldquo;മനുഷ്യന്‍ മതങ്ങളെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചു &hellip;&rdquo; , every one may love the song , but is never recognising the meaning and words .  So guys its time to wake up . Act wise , this is what education is <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  Thanks</p>
