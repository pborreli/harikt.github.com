    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE 30-03-2012: Fabien Potencier made the necessary <a href="http://harikt.com/comment/510#comment-510">changes to move the tests</a> to each components source folder. <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/fea6b79acdf01b79ac3d3206c001a9dec662da93">See commit</a> . That&rsquo;s a great move from Symfony&rsquo;s part . But what will happen to at Zend Framework?  The most awesome discussion that is happening in PHP world is recognizing the importance of <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2012/03/packages-the-way-forward-for-php">Components or Packages</a>. Bernhard Schussek even wrote a post on <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/">Symfony2 Form Architecture</a> and I wrote my thoughts and understanding on <a href="http://harikt.com/standalone-form-component-for-php">Standalone Form component for PHP</a>.  I would like to share the image of the low level architecture of the Symfony2 Form component from his post, uploaded to flickr for his bandwidth will not have any trouble.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/6819330426/" title="class-diagram2 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6819330426_359a8e4298.jpg" alt="class-diagram2" /></a>  So to conclude the Symfony Form has a minimal dependencies of Event Dispatcher which even can be replaced by writing a custom one that implements Symfony2 &rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher/blob/master/EventDispatcherInterface.php">EventDispatcherInterface</a> .  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> ah yeah.

I used to hang on in IRC of every channels, as my level of understanding and there are more awesome people who are better than me, I speak less there :&ndash;) , so feel free to correct here if you think at any point I am wrong. Looking from outside both Symfony2 and ZF2 is full of standalone components. But the reality is not the same. Though Symfony2 components are split into each components in github, you cannot give a pull request to that component. The tests for all the components still resides in the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/tests/Symfony/Tests/Component">core</a>. The same will be applying to <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/tests/Zend">Zend Framework 2</a> ( ZF2 ) too. I wrote my concern on the topic in mailing list of Symony2, if you are interested you can read on it <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/symfony-devs/CuwDO8LhReQ/discussion">here</a>.  Let&rsquo;s leave the contributions or pull requests, if I / you are trying to integrate Symfony form component to your project or library, we want to bring the tests some how make the necessary changes to the core if I want to make use of Event Dispatcher / Signal or another like Aura or Zend. Try to make how you can render in your view if I am using <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View">Aura View</a> or Zend or even in <a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/phly_mustache">phly_mustache</a>.  So let me tell you the design principle to make them as standalone have some failure. Coming back to Aura, as a small contributor I can see Paul M Jones right decision to make the component library has more to speak. The good thing is Aura has all the tests in one place for the component. For eg: consider <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router">Aura Router the routing component</a>. The source lies in src folder , the tests in tests folder.  The design principles of <a href="http://phix-project.org">phix-project.org</a> by Stuart Herbert is also a good when looking into it. So if you mentions its standalone, it should be easy to setup, easy to contribute etc. The Aura components have no depedencies on any of the components, and I feel the same will happen for the remaining Form, Filtering components which are still to be born. I wonder how Zend can make use of Symfony2, or do you mean a copy and paste of the components and changing namespace giving credits to it and making the necessary changes ? I don&rsquo;t know more on the MIT licence and is that what they want.  Please don&rsquo;t think I am disrespect to any of you, for I love the PHP community. <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt (@enygma) on Twitter</a> voiced his opinion on the decisions made by both Zend and Symfony community of using Zend_Log ( If you don&rsquo;t <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/#comment-17698">please have a look</a> ).  Update : I am not telling about installing dependencies for a project . Aura itself is using composer.json , so people can download it via composer and you can browse it from  packagist.org . My point was making use of different compoents from different Vendors with out dependencies on the other . For eg using Aura View, Symfony Form and Zend Validator , and if there is less dependencies and as I told if all tests reside at the same components github repo it makes life easier for developers to push and pull stuffs. Consider the movement of Drupal using Symfony components . Does Drupal 8 uses Symfony as a whole ? No its using some of the core components . So if they want to push something they can do easily. I want to dig more on composer to learn whether there is anything other than installation composer can do .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Update : I wrote an article on <a href="http://harikt.com/blog/2013/05/21/standalone-forms-and-validation/">Standalone Forms and Validation</a></p>

<p>Recently I was reading the post <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/">Symfony2 Form Architecture</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/webmozart">Bernhard Schussek</a> . The main aim of his post was to make use of
Symfony2 form component in Zend Framework 2 as the form architecture
which was written in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Forms">RFC</a> seems almost the same. This is a small
feedback I would love to give as I am interested to make the Form as a
standalone component, what ever framework we are using.</p>

<p>These all started with probably @fabpot tweets about it .</p>

<blockquote><p>Is it just me or is the <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523ZF2">#ZF2</a> form RFC heavily inspired by
<a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523Symfony2">#Symfony2</a>? /cc @<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a>

<p>Some months back as of Symfony2 stable was released I tried to
incorporate the Form component to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">Aura Project for PHP</a> which was
aiming for 5.3 at that time. But now looking forward to 5.4 + only</p>

<p>Let have a look into the Symfony2 dependencies for Form component which
is described in pear.symfony.com</p>

<p>EventDispatcher, Validator, Locale .</p>

<p>AuraPHP already have a Signal / Slot / Event Handler , so it doesn&rsquo;t
need the EventDispatcher, like the same ZF2 already have one, so I
feel EventDispatcher is not needed for both the frameworks. Lets don&rsquo;t
think what we have, lets see whether adding these components
really solve in creating to make it as a standalone component ?</p>

<p>I have taken a screenshot of the tweets I got in reply. Thanks to all
who tried to help me .Below is the link to the details, and I hope you
can go more detailed on the tweets if needed.</p>

<blockquote><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> You don&rsquo;t need Twig. Simply the Twig form rendering is
easier to get standalone. the PHP one is in the bundle @<a href="https://twitter.com/weaverryan">weaverryan</a>

<p>So what is missing for Symfony2 form component ? It needs more
components as shown in the gist  below</p>

<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1170166.js"> </script>
</p>


<p>So to conclude though the Symfony2 Form mentions as a standalone, its
not a standalone component at-least looking from a user point of view
like me. You can see various people asking about how to use Symfony2
Form component as a standalone in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/symfony-users/aAqDJjkl2gQ">google groups</a>. But what people
points is to Silex again build on the shoulder of Symfony2 component . I
am not against Symfony2 , please don&rsquo;t feel so. But I just want to bring
the fact that, than writing a big architecture, people would be looking
how we can integrate it as standalone .</p>

<p>So in my view I am looking forward to see how ZF2 will make a change
from Symfony2 or will it be the same like binding everything . I am also
looking forward to see how <a href="http://auraphp.github.com">Aura project for PHP 5.4</a> can bring Form .
I have limited knowledge, so I may be wrong on the above things too.
Feel free to correct me</p>

<p>I am looking for something like the one below, yes of-course we need
validation and stuffs , but it will be standalone , no matter :&ndash;) .</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
//PFBC 2.x PHP 5 >= 5.3   <br/>
session_start();   <br/>
include($_SERVER[&ldquo;DOCUMENT_ROOT&rdquo;] . &ldquo;/PFBC/Form.php&rdquo;);
$form = new PFBC\Form(&ldquo;GettingStarted&rdquo;, 300);
$form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Textbox(&ldquo;My Textbox:&rdquo;, &ldquo;MyTextbox&rdquo;));
$form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Select(</p>

<pre><code>"My Select:",
"MySelect",
array(
    "Option #1",
    "Option #2",
    "Option #3"
)
</code></pre>

<p>));
$form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Button);
$form->render();</p>

<p>//PFBC 2.x PHP 5
session_start();
include($_SERVER[&ldquo;DOCUMENT_ROOT&rdquo;] . &ldquo;/PFBC/Form.php&rdquo;);
$form = new Form(&ldquo;GettingStarted&rdquo;, 300);
$form->addElement(new Element_Textbox(&ldquo;My Textbox:&rdquo;, &ldquo;MyTextbox&rdquo;));
$form->addElement(new Element_Select(</p>

<pre><code>"My Select:", 
"MySelect", 
array(        
    "Option #1",        
    "Option #2",        
    "Option #3"     
)
</code></pre>

<p>));   <br/>
$form->addElement(new Element_Button);
$form->render();
```</p>

<p>An example where I can show such a standalone one is
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-form-builder-class/">http://code.google.com/p/php-form-builder-class/</a> . Currently to render
the form either you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/TwigBridge">TwigBridge</a> or <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle">FrameworkBundle</a> .</p>

<blockquote><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> There is 2 implementations: TwigBridge and in
FrameworkBundle but you could write one for Aura.View /cc
@<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a></p>

<p>— Christophe Coevoet (@Stof70) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stof70/status/177148060881788929">March 6, 2012</a></p></blockquote>

<script src="http://harikt.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>If you are using Framework bundle you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle/blob/master/Templating/Helper/FormHelper.php">Templating component</a> and
to my understanding if you are using TwigBundle you need Twig itself .
So is this a standalone ? Also if its really a standalone why it didn&rsquo;t
find a documentation as in
<a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html">http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html</a> . The Symfony2 has
released months back, so I don&rsquo;t feel Symfony2 form is a standalone in
the sense as I shown in the example .</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2011/10/02/symfony2-the-future-of-php/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T11:53:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2011/10/02/symfony2-the-future-of-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little about Symfony2 :  Symfony2 is a PHP 5.3 framework which follows the PSR-0 working group standard , which is also a fully rewrite after Symfony 1.X series .  Why I think Symfony2 the future of PHP :  Symfony2 is a framework build on top of different components. You can also build your own framework utilizing those Symfony2 components. Supports Database and Document based via Doctrine project ( Not reinventing wheel ). Great support for Twig a templating engine and PHP . I love templating engine for certain reasons. For eg ; Providing SAS we can make use of templating engine ;) . So we don&rsquo;t want to bother too much on the security aspects. ( If I am wrong correct me )  Symfony2 is the only PHP 5.3 framework which is released so far as I know ( not development, nor Alpha or Beta I am talking ).  A great community with great active development, which can utilize other PSR-0 components and library. You can see over the commits <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits/master">https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits/master</a> . I never have ever seen such a dedicated commits coming . Hands of to <a href="http://twitter.com/fabpot">@Fabpot</a> for the great effort he has made. But there are more <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/contributors">contributors</a>. But what I was mentioning was without a leader there will be nothing happening . I think the Symfony community will agree with this point .  Many of the Symfony2 components are already used by other PHP communities like <a href="http://blog.phpbb.com/2010/02/18/moving-on-the-future-of-phpbb-development/">PHPBB</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1178246">Drupal</a> etc .  A <a href="http://cmf.symfony.com/">Content Management Framework</a> is coming along the way . You can see who all are <a href="http://cmf.symfony.com/about">dedicated</a> to bring the next generation CMS. You can also join and be part of the movement.  Its utilizing PHPCR &ndash; Content Repository for PHP a great effort to port the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java">JCR</a> You can learn more from <a href="http://phpcr.github.com/">http://phpcr.github.com/</a> .  One more giant framework is coming Flow3 which will be the next framework for Typo3 version 5. It also have some of the same concepts from Symfony2 and utilizes Doctrine project . I played with it some weeks back and its on beta, what I feel is its multilingual support is coming on the way . But I am sure Typo3 Version 5 will surely support multilingualism. But isn&rsquo;t it good to start with Symfony?  Note :  I know Fuel is released and supports PHP 5.3 , but its not PSR-0 standard.</p>
