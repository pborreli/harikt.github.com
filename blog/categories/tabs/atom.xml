    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have created a repo <a href="https://github.com/harikt/seriosuly">seriously</a>, and have <a href="https://github.com/harikt/seriosuly/commits/master">3 commits</a> as of now .</p>

<p>It has a file <a href="https://github.com/harikt/seriosuly/blob/master/hell.php">hell.php</a>. I have created it by logging into <code>user X</code>
and with vim as the editor without any settings in .vimrc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/vim-tab.png" title="&lsquo;vim with no settings, and used tab&rsquo; &lsquo;vim with no settings, and used tab&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Then from user <code>harikt</code> I have edited with vim which has some .vimrc
setting like 1 tab = 4 spaces. Look into the <a href="https://github.com/harikt/seriosuly/blob/master/hell.php">code</a> and see how beautiful
it is.</p>

<p>Opening with geany it looks</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/geany.png" title="&lsquo;Oh from geany with settings 1 tab = 4 spaces&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh from geany with settings 1 tab = 4 spaces&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Let us don&rsquo;t create problems, but solutions!</p>

<p>It is just one line you need to mention</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to your editor settings set 1 tab = 4 spaces.&rdquo; . no?</p>

<p>Or you don&rsquo;t need to convert the tab at all?</p>

<p>Is your tabs 4 spaces, 8 spaces, 2 spaces?</p>

<p>Please fork and commit with your favourite editor mentioning the settings,
editor in your commit.</p>

<p>As as user I prefer consistency . And as I work with Aura, Symfony2,
ZF1, ZF2 I love to follow spaces, than individual projects choosing their
own styles which is a main benefit probably mostly to its users like me
than the core developers of individual system who don&rsquo;t care about
other projects or its users?</p>

<p>After all when your project says we use tabs, do you care people who love
to use spaces there? Do you merge when something like this comes?</p>
