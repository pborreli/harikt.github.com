    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reading an article in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/10/06/css-frameworks-semantic-class-names/">sitepoint</a> about the css frameworks . Though I have heard about the css frameworks earlier I was not able to get completely . But after seeing the article I thought of looking once again deeply into it .  Some of the most commonly used css frameworks are  1 ) Blue print CSS : <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">http://www.blueprintcss.org/</a>  2 ) 960 Grid system : <a href="http://960.gs/">http://960.gs/</a>  3 ) YUI Grid : <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/</a>  4 ) Elastic : <a href="http://elasticss.com/">http://elasticss.com/</a>  5 ) YAML : <a href="http://www.yaml.de/en/">http://www.yaml.de/en/</a> and many more .  You may be thinking why I thought of writing about CSS framework though I am a PHP developer ? Am I right ? Recently I got a chance to slice a website . As I am doing for the first time , it takes some time to complete it . The problems every one face is browser compatibility . Here comes the use of these frameworks .  These comes with inbuilt classes for the need and is fully tested <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But the only problem is with the name of the class ( Eg : grid_1 prefix_6 suffix_5 ) . What makes me interested to look again to the css frameworks after reading the sitepoint article is we can make custom classes now .  Yes every designers will be using the class names like header , footer , content , sidebar etc rather than the css grid_1 , grid_2 &hellip;. grid_15 . Though name is not a big deal for a good designer it makes some easiness for guys who donot have much css background .  We can download the psd of the grid systems and slice the website with the size provided in it . A screenshot taken from 960 grid is given below . Look carefully the menu and other parts and see how its done . We should use the grid system when we start designing it . So will help much not to arrange any more text and images to left and right when we start slicing it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3989881052/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3989881052_2e6d5a5d1a_o.png" alt="960 grid css framework example" /></a>  Thus we can increase our productivity for the sites ( As its tested in many browsers you may never spend much time. ) . It may take a few additional hours when we are new . But it will be really helpful in the future when slicing web site . Wish you good luck and try slicing a psd from scratch using your favourite css frameworks.  Updated : Now 960 grid system has one more layout , 24 column . Previously was only having 12 and 16 . I want to redesign this site using 960 grid . Hope I can come with a nice design for this drupal site . Want to brush up the theming concepts . Many things in the to do list .</p>
