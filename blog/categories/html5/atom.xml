    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a serious one , that you should never miss this Barcamp Kerala 11 th edition ( #BCK ) .Â  Opera evangelist Shwetank Dixit is with his talk HTML5 and beyond  I still remember his talk in 5th BCK, my first Barcamp, which was one of the reasons I got addicted to Barcamps. Yes there was lots of others too, but talk by evangelist is something different. You will recognize only if you have ever heard. I am really happy to see his talk in the <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">Barcamp sessions list</a>  Remember the next age is HTML5 , so dive into HTML5. Yes we can start developing HTML5 websites which old IE can also make use of it. Ask your developer to start learning about the modernizer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv">HTML5 Shiv</a>.</p>
