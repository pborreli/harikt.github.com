    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4978701845/" title="Richard Matthew Stallman by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/4978701845_6c85994243.jpg" alt="Richard Matthew Stallman" /></a>  As NIT was celebrating its Golden Jubilee this year , they was conducting a National Conference on Free Software and Education ie FOSS in Education.  I got a chance to be part of the Inaugral function held on Spetmeber 10th. Ricard Mathew Stallman was the Keynote addresse .  He talks slowly and clearly .  He says FOSS means Free and Open Source Software , I am not here to talk about opensource . I am here to talk about Free Software.  FSF and opensource are two different things .  He started talking about Free Software movement . The clutches of the developer controlling the user ( ie properitery one ) , and the other like the user controls the system .  The below lines are taken from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a> website .  “Free software” is a matter of liberty,<strong>not price</strong>. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”. Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:     * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).     * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.     * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).     * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  Example<strong>:</strong>  So are you confused with what Free Software is ?  You are going to build a house . You gave some contract to a builder named X . X build you the house and permits you to live . What will happen if he don&rsquo;t allow you to modify your house ? X says you don&rsquo;t have any right to modify it . You are unable to sell nor give it as rent . You are the person who spends the whole amount and you can&rsquo;t do anything with out X&rsquo;s permission . Is it a right thing ?  Lets come to the software world  So the philosophy is you asks a developer to build something for you and you pays him the money . He will develop all for you, and give you all the rights to use , modify , distribute so others can use it , learn etc as that of FSF policy.  He don&rsquo;t want to hide the code and says the code is ours. Why do he needs the code? If he is hiding the code , fear him , its the developer who is controlling you . You may not be a developer to know the power of coding :) , else you will defnitely fear .  There was a Qn and Answer session and it made everything more clear to those who thought Free Software means free as Price ( $ )  1 ) How can we make money ?  Ans : You can get some local work , and you need to work to earn money .  2 ) There is no MAT Lab . How can I switch to GNU / Linux ?  Ans : If I ( RMS ) found something that is not there in the GNU system , I ( RMS ) build it . So you need to develop one or you can find a developer and pay for it . So you can contribute to FSF .  Also why do you want to switch from GNU / Linux for not having this simple application ? There are very powerful tools in the GNU / Linux and you are loosing it for this simple application.  3 ) Some people says Windows will be effected by Virus and Switching from Windows to GNU / Linux is virus free .  Ans : We cannot gaurantee that virus will not effect your system . As far as I know there is 5 virus in GNU / Linux and may be due to the active presence of the community we are able to close the back doors .  I also met Juan Carlos whom I met at GEC thrissur for the <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/2009/01/hacker-dom.html">Hacker DOM</a> . He remembers the guys on the event . Asked about the details about <a href="http://sujithh.info/">Sujith H</a> one of the KDE hacker who hacks his Canon Camera in his free time.  The other great people in the inaugral function were  1 ) Welcome Adress : Prof K P Mohandas  2 ) Presidential Address : Dr . G R C Reddy, Director NIT Calicut  3 ) Inaugral Address : Shri Pradeep Kumar , MLA Kozikode  4 ) Felicitations    Dr A Achuthan , Institute of Engineers ( He is also celebrating his Golden Jubliee who joined the NIT, former REC )    Sri Binu A Pazhoor , CEO Kozhikode Cyber Park    Sri Nityananda Kamath , Former President, Calicut IT initiative    Sri R Sreeram Kumar , Counsellor , IEEE student branch    Sri A Rajagopalan , Chairman , Computer Society of India  5 ) Introducing Richard Stallman : Sri Sathish Babu  6 ) Keynote Address : Mr Richard Mathew Stallman ( named RMS inside FSF )  7 ) Discussion Question and Answer  8 ) Vote of Thanks : Hari C M , Student Co-ordinator .  The event started late and when Richard Stallman was given the mic it was around 7 : 00 PM . It was an awesome speech with great humour , but make people think .  He says some people suggest to learn both systems . ie GNU / Linux and Microsoft Windows . Let them learn both . He says its like giving Whisky and Water .  I was not with a camera , to take the snaps . But I and my father enjoyed the session and we left around 8:30 PM talking with Juan Carlos and all others . Lets promote FSF in Education . Let them know what FSF is , and what its for .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://windows7sins.org/"><img src="http://windows7sins.org/i/widget.png" alt="Windows 7 Sins" /></a>Though Microsoft has not officially released the Windows 7 , their new operating system , FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) has started the site <a href="http://windows7sins.org/">http://windows7sins.org/</a> . Many of you may be knowing Vista was a major failure for Microsoft , I got a chance to see the operating system from one of my friend . Its really a tough job to use it . May be because I was new to Vista and I was not using Windows XP . There are lots of changes in the Control panel itself which was really complicated to many people I think after they are coming from a Windows XP background .  As microsoft is telling their new OS will be light and users dont need to upgrade the hardware or buy new PC as Vista , we may need to see it . I don&rsquo;t know how much profit will the make after the release of Windows 7 as Google itself is into the OS market with the new Google chrome which is an opensource OS running on top of Linux kernel .  If microsoft stops the Internet Explorer browser then  webdevelopers like me don&rsquo;t want to work on windows from office too . As many of them are still using IE to browse the web. I do recommend Mozilla firefox for safer and faster browsing which is another opensource webbrowser which was once backed by the support of Google itself .  Guys I recommend you to use any distro of GNU/Linux . The Ubuntu one of the debain based distro may be the popular one used by many users for the cannonical was sending free CD&rsquo;s to home . There are lots of opensource and GPL based softwares . Enjoy the freedom of GNU/GPL and opensource .  I am a developer so I love to see the new technology and will try to learn from it . So I am not against the company or its product but only to the properitery licence . Linus Torvalds has once told in the introduction of git in google summer of code that he don&rsquo;t trust every one, and only trust a few . Like the same as I am a developer I don&rsquo;t trust all but the community . So we may sometimes need to look into the code to know how it works . Am I right ?
