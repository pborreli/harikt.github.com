    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We the ISPG &lsquo; ians ( Internet sales Promotion Group , a web development firm with main office at cochin ) celebrated Onam on 29th August 2009 . As the CEO Mr K G Sajith sir and some of the collegues ( especaily Sooraj sir who will be always the core player of any occation ) was at Bangalore and they were unable to attend the function . It was a really colourful event . We have missed the previous Onam as many were sick with Chicken pox.  Anoop sir was the Maveli of this year . He was looking great with the dress . Keeping one of the picture of him with some of the ISPG ians .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3930442199/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2451/3930442199_2580cd1ecb.jpg" alt="ISPG Maveli of 2009" /></a>  There was various cultural programmes like Tiruvathira kali , Onam song ( onapattu ) , skit , tug and war ( vadam vali or kamba vali ) etc .
