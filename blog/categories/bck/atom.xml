    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 13th edition of Barcamp kerala is on November 4th. This time I am going to talk on Dependency Management with Composer. In the 12th Barcamp I talked about Aura , and it was a bit technical , so Kenny was making sure, not to go for intensive code. So the talk will not be limited to composer. I will be giving you an introduction to Eath , and also a small project which I have done for my personal use fbsearch. The tool is used to search your own status messages you have posted some months back. Its still on alpha for I didn&rsquo;t get enough time to move on to make it much more better. It has some issues which I am already aware of. So if you are interested , be there :) .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a serious one , that you should never miss this Barcamp Kerala 11 th edition ( #BCK ) .Â  Opera evangelist Shwetank Dixit is with his talk HTML5 and beyond  I still remember his talk in 5th BCK, my first Barcamp, which was one of the reasons I got addicted to Barcamps. Yes there was lots of others too, but talk by evangelist is something different. You will recognize only if you have ever heard. I am really happy to see his talk in the <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">Barcamp sessions list</a>  Remember the next age is HTML5 , so dive into HTML5. Yes we can start developing HTML5 websites which old IE can also make use of it. Ask your developer to start learning about the modernizer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv">HTML5 Shiv</a>.</p>
