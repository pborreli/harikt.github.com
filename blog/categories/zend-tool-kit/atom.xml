But we will not understand how to bind each other ? Am I right ?  I am also new to Zend Framework . I like the ZF command line most. I looked for many articles , but many was in the old style . Recently I came to a pdf document which was very interesting which is used to administer the site . Every one will look for how to create an admin side using zend frameowork greater than 1.8 . Now its 1.9 too .  I am keeping the pdf which was seen from Slideshare by <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com/">Nick Belhomme</a>. This is a great one for each and every one to start . Hope it may help you . There are many more people who writes about Zendframework in their blog. I recently created a search to search those sites which I think may be helpful to you too .
