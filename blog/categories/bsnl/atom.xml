    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was trying to configure my BSNL ZTE EVDO device in Open-solaris . I configured the device too, but there is little trouble now too .  Open-solaris is having a project Wireless Wide Area Network , which is run to configure the wireless networks in solaris . The link to it is <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/wwan/</a> . I configured the modem using it . You need to be root to do it too . Also some times when running a command you may not be able to read the complete contents , for it exceeds the limit . So after the command add greater than symbol followed by filename ( I hope you know these commands too ) . Eg : prtconf -v > t . You can use gedit or vim or any text editors of your choice . The documentation is so good that I don&rsquo;t need to tell more .  The below is the scripts you may need to run every time .  pppd call evdo cp /etc/ppp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf cp /etc/nsswitch.dns /etc/nsswitch.conf  The problems I am facing still now are  1 ) Speed is slow compared with Ubuntu  2 ) I can search google , but we cannot proceed to a page shown in results .  3 ) You may need to restart each time when the net is stuck . ie no packets is coming to your n/w .  I don&rsquo;t get much time to look more in google for any helps .Â  What I think is crtscts needs some other option . I want to try it out and will let you guys know more about this .  If anyone has already configured let me know about it . One more thing it doesn&rsquo;t ask any passwords to connect . Its having only phone number . lol &hellip;. <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /></p>
