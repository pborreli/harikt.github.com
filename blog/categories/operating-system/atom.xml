    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently in googles blog , it has published a new tool called Google Builder , which is used to create a threee dimensional model for everything built on earth . Google describes builder as a game , but the others say its a tool .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008305011/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/4008305011_253151fe7d.jpg" alt="Builder not for you GNU/Linux users" /></a>  These are some of the things that the blog says we must be aware,  1 ) Builder maker is entirely a browser based and the list contains my favourite browser Firefox too .  2 ) You need to signup before you start the application .  3 ) Google Sketchup a free 3D modelling tool will help you edit and modify.  and some more things like this . You can read more about it from <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-building-maker.html</a> .  I was little curious and thought ( let me experiment my skills ) of trying it as its an online free tool.  But I this time too I am disappointed . Both the tools google sketup and google builder will support Windows and Mac . Its not supporting the powerful operating system GNU/Linux . I don&rsquo;t know how come we can call it as a browser based tool as once the isro says the map of isro is a browser based one . I can call it now as an Operating System dependent tool only till it can support every Operating Systems without installing additional softwares .  I am waiting for the release of the Google Chrome OS , so I hope the new tools will defnitely support GNU / Linux operating system .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don&rsquo;t know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .</p>
