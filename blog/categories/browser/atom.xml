    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a web-developer or having some exposure to computers will be knowing which one is the worlds most trusted secure browser .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4561079656/" title="chrome by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/4561079656_6a58fe4f79.jpg" alt="chrome" /></a>  Today I saw an advertisement when I was looking in.msn.com in google chrome, mozilla firefox etc . Seems funny and its really funny that their site scrolls up and never ends in their own browser ie8 which claims as the most secure browser. Oh sorry it never says its the most wonderful browser that renders properly :P , just says its the secure browser , but do you remember why google closed their china office? Great secure browser <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4560434483/" title="ie8 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/4560434483_1b62d7e4f6.jpg" alt="ie8" /></a>  You can see from the above picture how IE 8 is rendering when you scroll down . I don&rsquo;t think , at any point the scrolling ends <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Microsoft please fix that , I love to see it fixed . As its an advertisement they can show its the most secure browser , but how many of you will trust it ? Open-source browser&rsquo;s rocks and Firefox super rocks . Many seems interested in chrome too for the wonderful look and feel ( Chrome is free ) which was modified from the chromium open-source project hosted by google. Web is going with open-standards and please don&rsquo;t stop it moving forward with any more browser like IE6 . I heard IE 9 is pretty good, and have seen the site with the report and nice to see that you are much infront . But I am not sure whether all are correct too :) . Let&rsquo;s make the web as an operating system independet , cross browser compatible . Good luck guys to all in w3c .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was trying with two new addons . SkipScreen and Screengrab which is similar to FireShot but something extra .  SkipScreen is used to skip the wait time . For eg : When we try to download some files from rapid share we may need to wait for 150 seconds . This wait time will be reduced when you are using the skip screen . This will skip the wait time not only of rapid share , but for the many sites . I hope this will be  a wonderful tool for you if you are using the skipscreen addon of Mozilla firefox .  Screengrab which is similar to FireShot . But it has some more features . Both Screengrab and Fireshot is  a great tool especailly for web-developers . For eg : When we are adding a portfolio for a site we may need to grab a portion or the entire page. I have used the print screen and then the photoshop to make it. But now its simple with the help of screengrab and Fireshot . Both can take the entire page or the viewable part in the browser . But Screengrab can take a particular portion . You need just to drag the selection . It will get the screenshot for you . So no need to go and edit . But you can use photoshop or any other tool if needed .  Browse the other wonderful collection of addons from mozilla firefox and let me know what you think about the other .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3858966507_9aef76db9d.jpg" alt="image" />Learning Zend framework made me explore many new tools . The selenium IDE which is an add on for Mozilla is a wonderful tool for testers . For eg : we are humans and we may forget the actions done what all things we do . But we can record our clicks and inputs using selenium IDE . So when an error occurs we can show the developer what happens and what was the input entered etc .  I am really excited to see the Selenium IDE . I hope you testers and developers too will love this wonderful addon . Currently Selenium is supported by the browsers given below .  I have taken the list from the site . So if you are interested please do visit the site and get more information .
