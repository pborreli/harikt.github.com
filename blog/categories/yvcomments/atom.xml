    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to make my Joomla site work similar to a blog. Though my mind doesn&rsquo;t allow me to delete my blog in blogger , I thought of moving completely. I will not be deleting my blog , but will <del>not</del> ( Changed my mind still publishing in <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/</a> ) be publishing any more posts in blogger. I dont see a built in function for comments in Joomla. Comments help you recognise more about your posts and what others think . So installed comments feature.  I will be posting more topics in this site only , for I need to learn Joomla ( Dropped my plan, moved to DrupalÂ <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) . Yes if you want to learn something you need to try it out. So comments is a must . I need to spent some time to configure the comments feature. Some times I have even thought of moving to Drupal , for it has some good features like that . <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I want to learn how to configure comments feature in Joomla , so I will never quit . Yes success comes to my path .  Now the comments feature is here . All can post your comments , need an account here or an open ID . The one I have installed extension for comments is mod_comment , yvcomment plugin and yvcomment module The documentation is available at <a href="http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html">http://yurivolkov.com/Joomla/yvComment/index_en.html</a> . Its GNU/GPL . Have fun if you too need it .</p>
