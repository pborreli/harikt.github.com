    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First I would like to apologize O'Reilly for the dealy it happened.
So the buzz is AngularJS.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028055.do"><img class="center" src="/assets/images/books/angularjs.gif" width="180" height="236" title="&lsquo;AngularJS by Brad Green, Shyam Seshadri; O'Reilly Media&rsquo;" ></a></p>

<p>I took the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028055.do">AngularJS by Brad Green, Shyam Seshadri; O'Reilly Media</a> for review.
Both authors Brad Green and Shyam Seshadri has experience working at google and angularjs.</p>

<p>I have noticed people rating 5/5 mentioning the book covers to the point
etc. I am really new to angularjs and my reviews are based on it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can recommend the book for a person who is really new
to angularjs. Though it starts simple, at some point of time it jumps
to advanced parts or hard to follow. Don&rsquo;t think it is the problem with
book itself but the concepts are new and need a better way to explain.
Eg directives.</p>

<p>I strongly feel the introduction of yeoman, karma etc has added more frustration.
But I do like the introduction of debugging tools like Batarang.</p>

<p>These could have been taken to the last chapters if really needed.
There are many places where it could have been explained with better examples
than just small snippets of code where people don&rsquo;t know where to keep
and figure out themselves. Though there is a github repo with code,
chapter-5 doesn&rsquo;t have one.</p>

<p>I can give a rating of 3/5.</p>
