    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a web-developer or having some exposure to computers will be knowing which one is the worlds most trusted secure browser .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4561079656/" title="chrome by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/4561079656_6a58fe4f79.jpg" alt="chrome" /></a>  Today I saw an advertisement when I was looking in.msn.com in google chrome, mozilla firefox etc . Seems funny and its really funny that their site scrolls up and never ends in their own browser ie8 which claims as the most secure browser. Oh sorry it never says its the most wonderful browser that renders properly :P , just says its the secure browser , but do you remember why google closed their china office? Great secure browser <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4560434483/" title="ie8 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/4560434483_1b62d7e4f6.jpg" alt="ie8" /></a>  You can see from the above picture how IE 8 is rendering when you scroll down . I don&rsquo;t think , at any point the scrolling ends <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Microsoft please fix that , I love to see it fixed . As its an advertisement they can show its the most secure browser , but how many of you will trust it ? Open-source browser&rsquo;s rocks and Firefox super rocks . Many seems interested in chrome too for the wonderful look and feel ( Chrome is free ) which was modified from the chromium open-source project hosted by google. Web is going with open-standards and please don&rsquo;t stop it moving forward with any more browser like IE6 . I heard IE 9 is pretty good, and have seen the site with the report and nice to see that you are much infront . But I am not sure whether all are correct too :) . Let&rsquo;s make the web as an operating system independet , cross browser compatible . Good luck guys to all in w3c .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have used google chrome , you may have loved its simple menu, navigation etc. I love to make firefox somthing similar to google chrome .  Some firefox addons is necessary to change mozilla firefox look somthing similar to google chrome .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532378436/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4532378436_76b73c6a55.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Addons Needed  1 ) We need to hide the menu, so you can download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762</a>  2 ) Download Personnas , so you can dress mozilla firefox in different looks . You can get it from <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/">http://www.getpersonas.com/</a>  After downloading and installing addons, you need to restart firefox .  Steps involved  1 ) Tick only the navigation toolbar , ie Goto Views &ndash;> Toolbars &ndash;> Click on Navigation Toolbar ( If the menu is not showing you can use Alt + F , Alt + T, Alt + v , will make you jump to Views menu or use your favourite short cut keys )  2 ) Customize your navigation tool bar . ie Goto Views &ndash;> Toolbars &ndash;> Customize  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532380282/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4532380282_435c3ee8c2.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Here you can drag and dropthe things from the navigation . ie where we type the url and all . The left side buttons are draggable and dropped the other window . Try draggind and dropping  .  3 ) Enable Groovy Blue theme for the personnas ( for the bueish look ) or you can create a small image of the same colour of google chrome navigation  and dress your browser, creating new personnas :).  So the final look will be something like the one I showed at the top. Hope you like it :) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/10/19/great-wonders-world-mozilla-firefox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hope every one know about mozilla firefox ( Popular open-source web browser ) . If you are a webdeveloper you may defnitely know about <a href="http://www.harikt.com/tools-for-webdevelopers/42-firebug-a-handy-tool-for-web-developers">firebug</a> which is a handy tool . But today I would like to introduce some of the wonderful tools in the mozilla labs . Some of you may have already tried and know how powerful it is .  <strong>Ubiquity</strong> :  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026231282/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4026231282_ca08c5b0ef_m.jpg" alt="ubiquity" /></a>This is a wonderful tool and every one will love the great features . We can call this as a command line tool for Mozilla firefox. Don&rsquo;t think its so hard , its the one of the best tool which will help . Just a ctrl + space will start the ubiquity command. You can insert maps , contents , translate , bookmark to delicious , search , calculate etc .  Some of you guys may know me , I love command line and this tool is a great one which is changing the mozilla . It may be sometimes part of firefox after its released from labs . You can close tabs of particular url , title etc . Open the closed urls and many more . You just need to install ubiquity addon . Check out the page <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/">http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/</a> if you are interested to see it in action .  Check out the video and get inspired  If you are in GNU/Linux , then the short cut key conflicts , so you can change the ubiquity short cut key by going to the setting tab from about:ubiquity and chaging to your desired one . I am using ctrl + space for now , and its so easy to change to your easy remembering short cuts.  <strong>Personnas :</strong>  Many of them may have already tried Personas . ( For thos who don&rsquo;t know it ). Every one love to see their browsers in a variety of style . Then personnas is for you .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026228810/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2604/4026228810_c4f01afda4.jpg" alt="Personas" /></a>  Its a light weight plugin for firefox to change the style of firefox. Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/">http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/</a>  <strong>Prism :</strong>  Again if you are a GNU/Linux user you may have already tried Prism ( If you have tried to get an alternative for gtalk ) . It can work as a stand alone application for the desktop . A google talk desktop application uses prism.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025476843/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/4025476843_074999a00b.jpg" alt="Prism" /></a>  Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/">http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/</a>  <strong>Snowl :</strong>  Snowl is a wonderful tool if you are a blog reader , if you are participating in online discussions etc .

So its your time to get involved and participate with testing and make the user experience better and better .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025478051/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/4025478051_90fe1c5b50.jpg" alt="test pilot" /></a>  More information can be obtained from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/testpilot/">http://labs.mozilla.com/testpilot/</a>  <strong>Bespin</strong> :  Bespin is called as code in the cloud .

Its a wonderful opensource browser available for every Operating Systems . The firefox has a collection of Addons, which makes it much powerful than any other browser .  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/?from=sfx&amp;uid=267461&amp;t=322"><img src="http://images.spreadfirefox.com/affiliates/Buttons/firefox3/foxkeh-fx3-300x250.png" alt="Spread Firefox Affiliate Button" /></a>  I think I was little late to join the community spread firefox . But today I joined the community to spread the fire of the Fox . I have recommended many of my friends for using the nice browser. Once you use you will never go for any other browser . The community is powerful, this may be one of the greatest advantage of firefox . Go and try if you have not downloaded one .</p>
