    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday April 10th 2010 , two big events are going to happen in Kerala . If you were following me in twitter you may have noticed it . 1 ) Google Technology User&rsquo;s Group and 2 ) The Adobe Users Group launch event .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497299898/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4497299898_9872bb6922.jpg" alt="Google Technology Users Group Launch Event at Technopark" /></a>  I am Happy that kerala is also getting some user groups . Previously Bangalore was the hub and now we can see small groups peeping here and there all over kerala. The GTUG event venue is UST Global6th Floor (Zentith Hall) ,Bhavani,Technopark , Trivandrum. Timing is between 10 AM to 1 PM .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497302818/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4497302818_ffcec8241d.jpg" alt="Adobe Kerla Users Group Launch Event at Cochin" /></a>  Adobe Users Group Launch event is at Woods Manor Hotel , Cochin. I loved to attend both the events , but both on the same day at different locations . Though I am at cochin I will be moving to technopark , Trivandrum for the GTUG launch event. If you was following me , you may have seen my tweet some days back. I am little late to post in my blog due to certain reasons. The seats for both the events are limited and for the GTUG I think its almost finished . I am not sure about the Adobe event . So you guys can look both the events and can be part of your loving group . You can get more details about Adobe Users Group from <a href="http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/">http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/</a> and the Kerala Google Technology Users group from <a href="http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/">http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4408541076/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4408541076_af0003409b_o.gif" alt="Barcamp Kerala" /></a>  Finally the Eighth Barcamp (BCK8), is scheduled for 28th March, 2010, Sunday at Mar Athanasios College For Advanced Studies, Tiruvalla (MACFAST).  The image is got from a google search ( Thanks to <a href="http://laughingsquid.com">http://laughingsquid.com</a> ) and I made some edits <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( not much ) .  What will make this Barcamp awesome is the speech by Shwetank Dixit . He was one of the speaker previously in the Barcamp which was held at Technopark ( I think it was BCK5 ) . If you are a web-developer who works on server side languages like PHP , Pearl , Python , .NET or any or a designer who converts PSD to XHTML or moving to HTML5 , then you will defnitely love this .  Ya there are other speakers too that I love to hear . I am not going into all who are taking those sessions , its not becuase I don&rsquo;t love to write here , but its already there ;) . Catch it from <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/</a> . Be part of the awesome Barcamp held at Kerala .  <del>I am also planning to take a session. But I am not sure whether I want to go with it or not as I have not mastered it . Anyway if I get some time making some slides or prepare some I will go for a session . Let&rsquo;s wait and see , the date is on 28th , so some more days for me to prepare .</del> You can see the updated post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/looking-back-barcamp-8-mar-athanasios-college-advanced-studies-macfast">BC8 here</a> :).</p>

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/05/16/56-2009-election-results-of-kerala-and-india</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you first of all , this is just what I think, so forgive me if you don&rsquo;t like.  As all of you know it was a long wait for the one month long election process. My constitution was Calicut / Kozhikode . I have casted my vote on 16th of April . The main candidates were Muhammed Riyas and M K Ragavan of Congress. M K Ragavan has won the game with a lead of 838 votes. Let me congragulate him at this moment. Some of the reasons that Muhammed Riyas may have failed to win in the elections may be  1 ) Support for PDP  2 ) In the center Congress or BJP will only come . So why we need to give vote for LDF ? ( To support Congress ?) . We may get some good Ministers if we have good number of candidates.  3 ) CPIM has changed a lot from its previous stand .  4 ) I am not a person who is interested in religion / caste . I am a person who stands to support the poor and not on the basis of caste or religion . But the stand of the LDF have changed . You can see the candidates , which may be a game I think .  5 ) Not supporting Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam. This is a site each and every Indian must see and get inspiration <a href="http://www.abdulkalam.com/" title="Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam">http://www.abdulkalam.com/</a>. Somnath Chatterjee was a great person . CPI(M) expelled him.  6 ) Not making the right decision to change a leader if he is blamed as corrupted . Let the others come forward and if the corruption case is over it can be handed over . Why you need to be so much tensed ?  7 ) Failure of the LDF goverment in Kerala, in the educational sector like Professional Education . Even though they blame the court I don&rsquo;t think its the court that plays the game . Failure to make it clear infront of court is the failure of the goverment . What was the case when the congress was ruling here . I still remember the talks of K K Rakesh who has failed at Kannur . Failure to support the goverment employees who has fought against corruption like Suresh Kumar . Supporting ADB for which the LDF has made a lot of remarks .  Anyway the congress will come in the center . According to the latest news of malayalamanorma the UPA : 258 NDA : 162 Third Front : 066 Others : 057 . The third front is just a dream for now . The CPI( M ) has losts their seats in West Bengal and Kerala . This may be the right time to recognize the people , and what they think for the PB. The LDF only manages to get 4 seats and lost 16 . Lost their sitting seats too . The things I have pointed may not be the reasons , but some of you may agree . In my locality its the worst road I have ever seen. The sitting MLA U C Raman has given 50 Lakhs for the betterment . The panchayath is being ruled by LDF . Failure to repare the roads may also have added support to congress there I think . Like the same in every constituency each and every problems may have made this election a wonderful one.  Let&rsquo;s see the next 5 years of the congress lead government . Have a great day guys .</p>
