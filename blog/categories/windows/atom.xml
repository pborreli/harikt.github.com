    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://windows7sins.org/"><img src="http://windows7sins.org/i/widget.png" alt="Windows 7 Sins" /></a>Though Microsoft has not officially released the Windows 7 , their new operating system , FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) has started the site <a href="http://windows7sins.org/">http://windows7sins.org/</a> . Many of you may be knowing Vista was a major failure for Microsoft , I got a chance to see the operating system from one of my friend . Its really a tough job to use it . May be because I was new to Vista and I was not using Windows XP . There are lots of changes in the Control panel itself which was really complicated to many people I think after they are coming from a Windows XP background .  As microsoft is telling their new OS will be light and users dont need to upgrade the hardware or buy new PC as Vista , we may need to see it . I don&rsquo;t know how much profit will the make after the release of Windows 7 as Google itself is into the OS market with the new Google chrome which is an opensource OS running on top of Linux kernel .  If microsoft stops the Internet Explorer browser then  webdevelopers like me don&rsquo;t want to work on windows from office too . As many of them are still using IE to browse the web. I do recommend Mozilla firefox for safer and faster browsing which is another opensource webbrowser which was once backed by the support of Google itself .  Guys I recommend you to use any distro of GNU/Linux . The Ubuntu one of the debain based distro may be the popular one used by many users for the cannonical was sending free CD&rsquo;s to home . There are lots of opensource and GPL based softwares . Enjoy the freedom of GNU/GPL and opensource .  I am a developer so I love to see the new technology and will try to learn from it . So I am not against the company or its product but only to the properitery licence . Linus Torvalds has once told in the introduction of git in google summer of code that he don&rsquo;t trust every one, and only trust a few . Like the same as I am a developer I don&rsquo;t trust all but the community . So we may sometimes need to look into the code to know how it works . Am I right ?
