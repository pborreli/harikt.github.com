    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have told you , when your disk space is less, you can host your pictures in flickr, picasa or at some other place. I used to upload pictures to picasa , but some times the pictures are not loaded . But flickr is a nice solution .  Now you can edit the pictures uploaded to flickr using picnik tool. Flickr has partnered with picnik. So its easy to edit pictures after uploading to flickr . No need to edit from your system. Just upload it and edit online. It seems to be easy . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" />  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3577983096_44172c4e74.jpg?v=0" title="features available in picnik to those who upgrade it" alt="features available in picnik" /> There are various effects in picnik . You can make a particular place in colored in the picture and the remaining as black and white with Focal B/W . Cool right ? But you need to pay some . These additional features are available only for those who upgrade it.  Some of them are Neon , Snow effect, film grain , posterize etc. You can try it for free . Need to upgrade only if you love to save the picture . So why waiting go and try it man .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every one may have fallen in this trouble , when your disk space exceeds . Yes , I was trying to create a folder and upload some images . I noticed a fact , there is no space remaining to upload one . Yes , every one , who have a web hosting space may have thought an alternative way to store images and files . Yes, don&rsquo;t worry I just uploaded to my picasa web albums <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> .  But there is also another alternative if you have a database . Yes , you can store images and files in MySQL . To store images and files use the BLOB format . It can store binary data . What you need to do is  Create a table Image , with pkid of type int(10) as unique id , data of type BLOB , format ( jpeg , png &hellip; ) and description.  Read the binary contents from the image . using file_get_contents() or fread() functions of php .  Insert to database . Now you can retrieve the image using the id . Pass the id to a page which outputs the header of image . Yes, its pretty simple to do this . The below code is a sample . You can try it out . I have not tested , just made for the post now .  &lt;?php /* Create a table something like this CREATE TABLE `Labs`.`Images` ( `pkid` INT( 10 ) NOT NULL , `Content` BLOB NOT NULL , `Description` VARCHAR( 300 ) NOT NULL , `Type` VARCHAR( 5 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `pkid` ) ) ENGINE = MYISAM */ //insertImage.php $mysqli = new mysqli(&ldquo;localhost&rdquo;, &ldquo;my_user&rdquo;, &ldquo;my_password&rdquo;, &ldquo;database&rdquo;); /* check connection */ if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { printf(&ldquo;Connect failed: %s\n&rdquo;, mysqli_connect_error()); exit(); } //Read file contents $fp = fopen(&ldquo;image.jpg&rdquo;,&ldquo;rb&rdquo;); $contents = fread( $fp , filesize(&ldquo;image.jpg&rdquo;) ); fclose( $fp ); if ($result = $mysqli->query(&ldquo;INSERT INTO Images(&lsquo;pkid&rsquo;,&lsquo;Content&rsquo;,&lsquo;Description&rsquo;) VALUES(&lsquo;NULL&rsquo;,&lsquo;&rdquo;.$contents.&ldquo;&rsquo;,&lsquo;test me&rsquo;)&rdquo;)) { echo &ldquo;Successful insert&rdquo;; } $mysqli->close(); ?> &lt;?php //getImage.php $mysqli = new mysqli(&ldquo;localhost&rdquo;, &ldquo;my_user&rdquo;, &ldquo;my_password&rdquo;, &ldquo;database&rdquo;); /* check connection */ if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { printf(&ldquo;Connect failed: %s\n&rdquo;, mysqli_connect_error()); exit(); } //Read image contents if ($result = $mysqli->query(&ldquo;SELECT Content FROM Images WHERE pkid = &lsquo;&rdquo;.$_GET['pkid&rsquo;].&ldquo;&lsquo;&rdquo;)) { $row = $result->fetch_assoc(); } header('Content-Type: image/jpeg&rsquo;); echo $row[&lsquo;Content&rsquo;]; ?>  <img src="getImage.php?pkid=<?php echo $pkid ?\>&ldquo; alt=&rdquo;&lt;?php echo $description ?>&ldquo; title=&rdquo;&lt;?php echo $description ?>&ldquo; />  This is just a sample. I hope you know some basics of PHP . You can modify the script as needed, and also do care about SQL injections <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" title="Tongue out" alt="Tongue out" /> . You can encrypt the values that are passed for additional security measures . Have not tested this , just made this in a hurry . So may contains errors. Please do report if you find some . I will be happy to hear it from you .  You can use the sameway to store the word , pdf etc in the MySQL . Its simple to make it work . You can change the content type of header , so as to make it dynamic .</p>
