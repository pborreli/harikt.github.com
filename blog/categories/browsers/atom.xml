    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if you have Windows, sometimes you may be facing the same problem. You may need to check IE 6 , 7 , 8 . I used to work from GNU / Linux . But recently I came to a site which gives the live screenshots of the webpages in different operating systems with different browsers . This made me think how it works :) .  Yes its easy to implement it . You just need a Windows machine with IE6 , another with IE7 , and IE8 . So now it has 3 machines with 3 IE versions . You can either login to the other machine using the remote desktop and check the browser compatibility there .  This is also a cheapest way to reduce the cost of developement according to me . By this way every one can login to their GNU/Linux machine and login to remote desktop to test the IE versions . Windows 7 comes with some , and I have heard that there is some softwares also to make IE 6, 7, 8 work on a single machine . But I am not much aware of  the softwares as I don&rsquo;t have a Windows running in mine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I welcome any of the windows users to come and contribute to this . I will be much more happier to hear from you . You can write the comments <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> and let me know what you think .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don&rsquo;t know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .</p>
