    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>May be the question is so simple for you. But many times I feel it much complicated. Everyone would have started their website with a custom cms and later moved to Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or something similar. I used to look for a better book in any language which has design decisions made for the cms to make it such a way that it can be extended. Some of the books that seems interesting to me are 1 ) <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430218791">Pro Zend Framework CMS</a> 2 ) <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition/book">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a> It will be great to see if you have came across such books or do you recommend any other books. I am not just looking for PHP, but I am interested to read any sort of books, which will help me to build the next blogger. Waiting to hear you suggestions on the same.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Packt publishers who loves opensource have come up with the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">PHP5 CMS Framework Development</a> . I was one of the technical reviewers of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">PHP5 CMS Framework Development</a> . If you are a developer you may have thought , why I need to read the book . I know how to develop a CMS ( Content Management System ) . Ya I agree, well we all know how to develop a CMS . Anything that store something in db, which has functionalities like CRUD you can call it as CMS. But you may not be developing something that we can extend . Once a website is developed maintaining it is hard . So before developing a system we must know how we can extend it , ie what we call as a CMS framework . Some of the examples of the popular CMS frameworks are <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> , <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://mambo-foundation.org/">Mamboo</a> etc .  The author of the book is Martin Brampton who is a former development team leader on the renowned Mambo open-source content management system. Now he is the project leader of the open-source CMS <a href="http://aliro.org/">Aliro</a> . Joomla , Aliro , MiamiCMS etc were forks of the mamboo project . So if you are looking how these systems works , I suggest you this book . A book has its own limitations of walking you through each and every line . So he has covered all parts of the system in a nice way . I have gained some knowledge reading the book . So I hope you too will enjoy the book . The examples of the book are all from the project Aliro , which is an open-source CMS system . So get it while its hot .  Language :  English Paperback : 416 pages [ 235mm x 191mm ] Release Date : August 2010 ISBN : 1849511349 ISBN 13 : 978-1-84951-134-6 Author(s) : <a href="http://twitter.com/martinbrampton">Martin Brampton</a>  Buy the book from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book">Packt publishers</a> and you can see Table of Contents <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/toc/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition-table-contents">here</a> .  Still looking for a chapter by chapter review ? A wonderful review of the book is written <a href="http://www.ds-o.com/archives/76-Book-Review-PHP5-CMS-Framework-Development-by-Martin-Brampton.html">here</a> . I am too lazy to write such a long one :) .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What is Joomla ?  Some of my friends asked me &ldquo;Your site is powered with Joomla . Whats is Joomla ?&rdquo;  So let me tell something about Joomla ,for the site uses it .  Joomla is a Content Management System ( CMS ).  What do you mean by a CMS or Content Management System ?  A CMS is a computer software system for organising and facilitating collobarative creation of documents and other content. A CMS is frequently a web application used for managing web sites and web content .  Is Joomla the only CMS ?  No , there are lots of other CMS systems . Some of the popular CMS are Joomla , Drupal , Maboo , Typo3 , Wordpress etc . These CMS are all free and under the licence of GNU / GPL or in the opensource licence. As its free you can download change and redistribute , and enjoy the power of free software .  What I feel about Joomla , Drupal , Typo3 , Wordpress ? Joomla is a powerful award winning Open Source CMS system. When you install it for the first time with sample datas, you will defnitely love it. Mainly due to the template ja purity . Joomla has lots of extensions and plugins. So customizing the design is some what easy .You can see many sites are now running in Joomla. The recent site I visited is <a href="http://tatanano.inservices.tatamotors.com/tatamotors/">http://tatanano.inservices.tatamotors.com/tatamotors/</a> of the tata nano . Yes build in Joomla. Some of the sites of kerala government is in Joomla.Found finance ministers site .  Drupal is also a wonderfull CMS . I have not explored it a lot like Joomla . Just tried here and there only . Joomla uses frame works. Some from zend is also being used. Recently I was reading in a Joomla forum about the designing of a news paper site. One guy has recommended Drupal for it and he tells although Drupal has ugly templates , making a news paper site is simple in Drupal than in Joomla . He has a list of sites also which runs on Drupal. So I thought of trying it in Joomla , then later in Drupal too. I want to explore some of the plugins in Joomla, also in Drupal <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif" title="Wink" alt="Wink" />.  Typo3 is also another CMS that so many people are using. It uses formidable template engine. If you need to customize the design and all, you may need to learn it first. So some what hard I think. I have not installed and configured one. It has a lot of feature, as the developers itself tell you , you can&rsquo;t learn typo3 in 2 days. If you need to learn in 2 days , you can go for some other cms. Yes its hard to learn, but I agree with them that , once you learn , you will be the master. Some of the features I liked in it are the manage mutiple sites from one backend. Its simply superb . Today ( 26-03-2009 ) I some how installed Typo3 . Its hard for a newbie. Really hard. Though its has documentation and all, its not easy as Joomla or Drupal. Anyway I would like to learn it . Some of the things that I am interested to work on the future are smarty , frameworks ( Zend or Symfony ) , drupal , joomla , wordpress , sugar crm &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. and many more .  Wordpress is the easy one which any one can maintain . Though Joomla , Drupal , Typo3 etc claims easy to maintain and all , its not much easy as Wordpress. Wordpress is mainly used for blogging. When I started my blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com">http://ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> at blogger I found many sites which have used the term &ldquo;powered by wordpress&rdquo; . At that time I also downloaded the wordpress , but I was unaware how to make it work . Wordpress is the first one I have installed in my local system after knowing about it from my college days . It was Dilpu&rsquo;s blog which uses wordpress. Now the site is no longer available. He is not maintaining that site , but now is in blogger I think. Anyway it was he who have shown me the real path . So thanks to him . So if you are interested in blogging I recommend wordpress . You can use Drupal , Joomla etc , but you need to spend some time learning about it .  Will add more contents to it . Stay tuned :) .</p>
