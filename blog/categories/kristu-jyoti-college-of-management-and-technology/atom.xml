It<del>s scheduled for</del> was on 20th December, 2009, Sunday at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology, Kottayam .  <del>I hope to see you guys there .</del>Hearing about barcamp for the first time ? Wiki have the answer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  This Barcamp 7 was really really interesting . If you are a techie you missed it, thats what I can say .  Some of the sessions were  1 ) Barcamp Kerala (History and Present) by Kevin Babu 2 ) 3D Computer Graphics Programming by Praseed Pai 3 ) Building complex web site the Drupal way by Fredrik Jonsson 4 ) Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech by Kenney Jacob 5 ) Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX ( by Sunil ) 6 ) Innovation! &ndash; &ldquo;The UST Global Way&rdquo; by Harikrishnan Nair 7 ) Multi Monitor Machines by Binny V A 8 ) Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan  This time my favorite one was presnted by Fredrik Jonsson &ldquo;Building complex web site the Drupal way&rdquo; . He was a person from Sweden who have came here on vaccassion. I have planned that what ever thing happens I will go to Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technlogy only because of his presntation . I love Drupal and I was interested to learn something he knows . He has already done some websites in Drupal . I got a chance to discuss with him and also Thanks for sharing his slides .If I get a picture I will keep it here .  I was little late so I didn&rsquo;t cover the presentation by Kevin Babu . Sorry the private buses from Ernakulam to Kottayam was on strike .  When I reached there Praseed Pai was the person who was speaking about the 3D Computer Graphics Programming. He just takes me to my college life . The last semester programming computer graphics . Algorithms used for drawing lines , Open GL and so on . Thanks for taking me to my college CUIET again in Barcamp .  Kenny Jacob came up with the &ldquo;Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech&rdquo; . We discussed some of the recent issues like total for you sabarinath case , love jihad issues etc .  Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX was also a great session . I think people like him are missing in the colleges. I have only some faces like him in Engineering Colleges . These type of guys are really needed in Engineering Colleges to make more professional software developers .  Innovation! &ndash; &ldquo;The UST Global Way&rdquo; by Harikrishnan Nair was a great one . He spoke about the Microsoft share point which the UST uses . He was poiting Microsoft guys called them and they were having a webinar with them . I have a chit chat with him , and he appreciated us for conducting these type of events .  I was hearing about the Multi Monitor Machines for the first time from my client, then from Eric of devzone and now I know Binny V A is using one . He invited us to his home to see the working demo. I am interested to visit and see a live session. So Binny you can expect me at any time <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan was a good one . I can see more systems coming to Barcamps are with Ubuntu . Great to see that open-source and GNU/Linux and all are changing the world .  And finally we have a talk about the entrepreneur ship and the freelancing, which was not included in the session . Some of them came with their models . One of the father came and told about his experience learning and working and building the organisation . I loved his speech and that was really awesome . He invited us for the BCK8 at his college premises . Thanks to him for the offer . Hoping to see you on BCK8 there .  Forgot to tell you that we celebrated the Christmas by cutting a cake by Fredrik Jonsson our guest for the BCK7 . Let me celebrate this Christmas with the moments from Barcamp Kerala 7 . I hope every one who was there enjoyed . During the return also I enjoyed with the barcamp guys . Thanks for the lift also Mr Dileep .</p>
