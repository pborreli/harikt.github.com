    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, when you are new to webhosting, then I am sure you may fall in trouble . You may be looking for cheap hosting , which may not be reliable. If your site doesn&rsquo;t get much traffic , then it may not be a big deal . But when your site is getting some what hits , then you may need to call each and every time your hosting service provider.  Some of the things must be taken in to consideration when you are moving for web hosting . Never go for the cheapest hosting. That doesn&rsquo;t means when the cost is high they give good support <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The cheapest hosting is provided to you by means of VPS .A VPS is really for small developers , but some times hosting companies make use of this . The load will be balanced to every VPS , even though one of the VPS guys ask for increase in memory or any .  Ask your friends who are some what familiar with web hosting or servers. My friend Prajith was very helpful to find me a good solution. Though there were some troubles occured , they resolved the problem quickly. The support is the one that you need. When they don&rsquo;t turn up to answer you , it will be some what horrible .  <strong>Fake content :</strong> This is the one thing that you must consider , when you are looking for hosting or finding some business outside your country . I can write what ever things like, I was born on 1970 or I have started this site from 2000 onwards or something. But some of the things can be looked if you know . For eg : When some firms says we are here from 1995 onwards , then the best way to know is just a whois look up. I used to look for whois to get some information . Alexa is another solution that you can try . You can try and know the fake guys . So this is one of the important thing that you must take into consideration . I have seen some fake contents like this . But I know how to know , but sometimes you may fall in trouble if you don&rsquo;t know.  You can look for the forum if , you don&rsquo;t know a friend who is familiar.  I can also help you to find a good solution as my site is proudly hosted at <a href="http://rackloop.com/">http://rackloop.com/</a> . Although they are new , they have great knowledge working with servers. These guys are great and you will love their support . You can see how fast my site is loaded , even though its Joomla and some seo friendly htaccess tricks are used.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every one uses internet in their day today life , like a cup of tea . Yes , the world wide web has gain great popularity . I don&rsquo;t know , whether the common man have ever thought how the world wide web works ?  Individuals or organizations , publish the details to the public with the help of hosting server . A server is a powerful system , which will be always on , having a dedicated IP address to recognize it in the WWW . There are many types of hosting services . Some are  1 ) Dedicated Hosting  2 ) Virtual Private Server or VPS  3 ) Content Delivery Network or CDN  4 ) Shared Hosting etc.  I am new to the world of hosting. I don&rsquo;t run a hosting business too . But , every one will learn when you enter into the web hosting . Yes , I got some space to host my site. There are many free hosting services. The problem&rsquo;s with free hosting servies are  1 ) Some provides ad&rsquo;s of their own .  2 ) We don&rsquo;t know when will they block our site ( as its free it can be removed at any time )  So I thought of getting some space . Now a days I used to read many blogs and sites . From there I was hearing about the terms VPS , Dedicated server , CDN etc .  <strong>Dedicated Server :</strong>In dedicated server, the company has great freedom , for the choice of the operating system , and other software that needs to be installed. The server is dedicated entirely to you and is not shared with any others . For a dedicated hosting the cost is high than that of the VPS .The dedicated servers will be always hosted in some other locations called data centers.  <strong>VPS ( Virtual Private Server )</strong>: A virtual private server means , there will be only one server hardware . Many different operating systems will be installed on it . For eg : After installing a sun solaris os , we may install another operating system ubuntu or some other with the help of virtuaisation softwares like the vmware or virtual box or any other. Each operating systems can be booted with out restarting the server . The hardware will be shared by this virtualisation system . So we may feel , the server is working entirely for us, though its not the case. When some other VPS is over loaded , the other VPS will also have trouble to load their sites. Mainly the VPS is made for small business . But now a days cheap hosting is possible with this VPS . The hosting companies , use a VPS for a small cost . They sell the space for each users , for less amount , but the problem is with the speed and uptime. The server may fail at any moment.You may need to call each time . So going for cheap hosting is not a good solution .  <strong>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</strong> : Content Delivery network is a great solution for those whose web pages have a great traffic. Its huge in cost . I was only aware about the CDN now a days . Though we may be familiar about the term cluster computing we may have not looked seriously. A CDN is nothing but dedicated servers at different locations . Think you have a server at US , India , Europe and some other locations . When a request for a page is from India , you can transfer to the Indian server , when its from America , then to American server. The benefict is greater speed , network traffic will be reduced. A CDN is always a great choice . The ZEND is using the CDN technology to transfer the files. We can recognize how fast it works . But when considering the cost , its some what huge . Its really very interesting to learn how the server works.Really interested to learn about these technologies &hellip;&hellip;..</p>
