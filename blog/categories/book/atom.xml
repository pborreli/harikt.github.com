    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2012/07/17/rest-api-design-rulebook-by-mark-masse/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has been hearing the buzz REST. As web services and api for websites are becoming popular, all are busy developing REST api&rsquo;s for their websites. What exactly is REST? REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed systems such as the World Wide Web. REST has emerged over the past few years as a predominant Web service design model. This is what wiki mentions . The book REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé; O'Reilly Media will teach you some rules which needs to be followed. This book has really helped me to understand some of the basic concepts of HTTP protocol. Yes really I was able to understand more on REST and how it should be represented etc. Probably you would have noticed websites with format .html , .json , .xml . If you have ever thought its REST, then its not :&ndash;) . Do you know a trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs ? Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs ? There are more rules , but you can read and learn the rest from the book. The book has a total of 94 pages, but will serve you for a good reference. It also introduces WRML (<a href="http://www.wrml.org/">http://www.wrml.org/</a>) . Cons : Yes I feel there are some cons for the book. There are some examples when introducing WRML like the one below . {syntaxhighlighter class=&ldquo;html&rdquo;} application/wrml; format=&ldquo;<a href="http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json">http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json</a>&rdquo;; schema=&ldquo;<a href="http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player">http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player</a>&rdquo; {/syntaxhighlighter} But when you point your browser to <a href="http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json">http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json</a> you will get a 404. Example url : Its always a good way to mention example.com than mentioning <a href="http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player">http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player</a> . There are at many places its happening . You will not get completely on a first read when the chapters are moving, but sometimes you may want to read it many times. But I loved this book for I learned some basic stuffs really and also this is always a reference for future. In a rating of 5 , I will rate 4 . If you are interested in this book, you can buy this from REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé : <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021575.do">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021575.do</a> Pages: 116 Print ISBN:978-1-4493-1050-9 | ISBN 10:1-4493-1050-8</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OAuth the future of login? People are bored of registering and remebering user passwords on different websites. So the future of OAuth or using it in your daily life when developing website or apps is not that much far. Already many websites have been using it. This book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021810.do">Getting Started with OAuth 2.0</a> by Ryan Boyd published by O'Reilly Media is an awesome must read book. The author Ryan is a developer advocate at Google focused on enabling developers to extend Google Apps and build businesses on top of Google technology. He previously worked on OpenSocial and led the developer relations team for Google’s AtomPub APIs. Ryan has a great of knowledge of what he is talking about. The concepts of oauth was easy to understand, he has provided enough examples on how to use it in PHP, Javascript and HTML. I have already written an article at phpmaster<a href="http://phpmaster.com/integrating-with-facebook/">integrating facebook with php</a>. So if you ever thought of integrating oauth 2.0, its good to learn the concepts, so you can just relay on Http client library. Its a small 65 page book, but is worth . The book doesn&rsquo;t include or teach you how you can create your own oauth server , that is ok for its getting started with oauth. This book deserves a Rating of : 10 / 10 . Anything more you need to know?

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Book Review Kohana 3.0 Beginner's Guide By Packt]]></title>
    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2011/09/18/book-review-kohana3-beginners-guide-by-packt/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-18T22:16:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2011/09/18/book-review-kohana3-beginners-guide-by-packt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks back I finished the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/kohana-3-0-for-professional-web-applications-beginners-guide/book">Kohana 3.0 Beginner&rsquo;s Guide</a>. As the name suggests its so simple that anyone new to PHP can learn Kohana. Yes I recommend learning a framework if you are a PHP Developer . It has lots of advantages, that you will come across in your development life.( Not going deep on it ) . The author of the book is Jason D. Straughan, published by Packt. As a reviewer I must be open, so its open from the mind. I love packt and have no issues with the author ( I don&rsquo;t know him personally nor have any grudge ), but for a buyer its not like that. So forgive me. I started reading the book with a great enthusiasm, though its not a 5.3 framework, but to learn the principles and learn the good things of HMVC. Its annoying for a newbie if you see some errata&rsquo;s even though he doesn&rsquo;t know its an errata. The single quotes and double quotes have issues almost many parts of the book. Yes we can say the books code is online, so correction is easy. So I am not talking anymore about the Errata&rsquo;s . Because there are some :), may be due to the format issues arised when sending back and forth . The book talks about Kohana version 3.0. But the current version is 3.2 . There is compatibility issues with 3.2, 3.0 . Not sure about 3.1 though . I played downloading 3.2 and I was stuck. The books page 312 mentions about the support for each release . So after each 6 months new versions will come and the support is for 1 year. Around the 5th chapter it introduce the ORM used in Kohana and I loved that chapter . The missing things I love to see in the book are Ajax support, or how ajax support is achieved, named routing. ie without the module/controller/action/id stuffs. This is always the default one. As its a hard to do with an open-source book to maintain the pace the code is pumped I feel Packt want to follow the way <a href="http://progit.org/">http://progit.org/</a> . So a book for the community and will be brought by people , so always upto date and correct . Writing a book is hard, but for a reader he must not be aware, but just the contents . Download Sample Chapter : <a href="http://bit.ly/qT14Hi">http://bit.ly/qT14Hi</a> Beginner Level Programmer ( Ignoring Errata ) : 3 / 5 Moderate Developer Rate : 2 / 5 . Personal Opinion is Packt should take much more seriousness before publishing open-source books for the life span of writing the book may go and the software may have started another version. Also there are a lots of good books by Packt, which are being burried due to the opinions people raising against the low quality books like this. Feel free to correct me, always good to get in touch with the open-source community leader and ask suggestions before jumping to publish a book. You have some good stuffs missing like Mongo , Couch , Developing a multilingual website from scratch etc. Great topics on the list . On Symfony2 Beginners guide , Advanced and lots :) . Don&rsquo;t dump it, colloborate and bring it we are waiting :) .</p>
