    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 7 days from the release of Windows 7 , ubuntu 9.10 is here . I was waiting for the release of 9.10 officially, and was looking the features .  Its really awesome guys . Some of the features are  1 ) Empathy is made as the default chat client and Evolution the email agent . If you are a mozilla fan you can get it from the new software center .  2 ) Software center has changed the old Add/Remove programs .  3 ) Free 2GB online storage , to share your datas with friends and collegues . Its really cool <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , and I hope many of you may utilise it . Anyway I will .  4 ) Mozilla Firefox 3.5 , my favourite browser hope your too ( especailly if you are a webdeveloper ) . So you can go for the addons in the mozilla labs .  And the remaining are the usual tools for graphics , games and office . If you are interested to see the features go and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/910features">get it from ubuntu</a> .  Ah how is windows 7 performing dudes ?
