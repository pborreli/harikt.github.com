    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hope every one know about mozilla firefox ( Popular open-source web browser ) . If you are a webdeveloper you may defnitely know about <a href="http://www.harikt.com/tools-for-webdevelopers/42-firebug-a-handy-tool-for-web-developers">firebug</a> which is a handy tool . But today I would like to introduce some of the wonderful tools in the mozilla labs . Some of you may have already tried and know how powerful it is .  <strong>Ubiquity</strong> :  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026231282/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4026231282_ca08c5b0ef_m.jpg" alt="ubiquity" /></a>This is a wonderful tool and every one will love the great features . We can call this as a command line tool for Mozilla firefox. Don&rsquo;t think its so hard , its the one of the best tool which will help . Just a ctrl + space will start the ubiquity command. You can insert maps , contents , translate , bookmark to delicious , search , calculate etc .  Some of you guys may know me , I love command line and this tool is a great one which is changing the mozilla . It may be sometimes part of firefox after its released from labs . You can close tabs of particular url , title etc . Open the closed urls and many more . You just need to install ubiquity addon . Check out the page <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/">http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/</a> if you are interested to see it in action .  Check out the video and get inspired  If you are in GNU/Linux , then the short cut key conflicts , so you can change the ubiquity short cut key by going to the setting tab from about:ubiquity and chaging to your desired one . I am using ctrl + space for now , and its so easy to change to your easy remembering short cuts.  <strong>Personnas :</strong>  Many of them may have already tried Personas . ( For thos who don&rsquo;t know it ). Every one love to see their browsers in a variety of style . Then personnas is for you .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026228810/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2604/4026228810_c4f01afda4.jpg" alt="Personas" /></a>  Its a light weight plugin for firefox to change the style of firefox. Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/">http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/</a>  <strong>Prism :</strong>  Again if you are a GNU/Linux user you may have already tried Prism ( If you have tried to get an alternative for gtalk ) .

A google talk desktop application uses prism.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025476843/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/4025476843_074999a00b.jpg" alt="Prism" /></a>  Check it out from <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/">http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/</a>  <strong>Snowl :</strong>  Snowl is a wonderful tool if you are a blog reader , if you are participating in online discussions etc .
