    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long wait I too got my google wave . My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ArunBasilLal">Arun Basilal</a> got wave .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817864/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2735/4068817864_b7dac4e3c7.jpg" alt="Hari K T on google wave" /></a>  I requested him and he was ready to send me an invite and was invited on 28th October . I was waiting and waiting and google may have tested my patience . And finally today ( November 2nd ) I was telling <a href="http://twitter.com/priyanr">Priyan</a> to send me one more , as wave didn&rsquo;t reach after 48 hours .  Priyan was Happy and send me an invite . Opening gmail IÂ was really Happy to see the the google invite from Arun Basilal of <a href="http://www.millionclues.com">Million Clues</a> . Thanks once again Priyan and Basilal .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4068817870/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4068817870_4986515ce4.jpg" alt="Hari K T making Google wave in action" /></a>  Not explored much in wave . I want to make experiments with it. Thanks to all and Thanks to google for making a wonderful application .  Still wondering what wave is ? Oh then the video is for you . Get inspired and rock on wave . Google wave at present needs invitation .  Hope this video made you crazy .  Updated on 07 November 2009 : After some days of using google wave I feel that google wave will not rock until every user gets one . Many are inactive for you may be having only a few people in your contacts who uses wave . So they just check wave once a day . Its a great colloborative tool, and I know that it will rocks in the future. So you guys may want to wait until you get an invite . Its always good that developers get wave invite rather than just users ;) .  11 th November 2009 : I have a very few google wave invites. If anyone is interested in it , just drop a comment . I will send it to you , if its not over . Just 8 invites are there <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So the first 8 will get it .</p>
