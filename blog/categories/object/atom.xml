    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is some what interesting post to many of you . I have tried some time to make this correct for one of my friend Jaisenan . I like debugging, so spend some time to make this working. We was looking to get the value in a multidimensional array . One of the value in the array was an object. And this was the big problem , and was looking to solve it . Here is the array  $x = Array ( [#theme] => content_multiple_values [#title] => Face to Face Time [#required] => 0 [#description] => [0] => Array ( [#type] => duration_combo [#default_value] => Duration Object ( [duration] => Array ( [years] => 0 [months] => 0 [days] => 0 [hours] => 0 [minutes] => 0 [seconds] => 0 )  [is_negative] => [is_valid] => 1 [conversion_factors] => Array ( [seconds/minutes] => 60 [minutes/hours] => 60 [hours/days] => 24 [days/weeks] => 7 [days/months] => 30 [weeks/years] => 52.142857142857 [months/years] => 12 )  )  [#largest_metric] => hours [#smallest_metric] => minutes [#element_validate] => Array ( [0] => duration_combo_validate )  [#title] => Face to Face Time [#description] => [#required] => [#weight] => 0 [#delta] => 0 [#columns] => Array ( [0] => iso8601 [1] => approx_seconds )  [#field_name] => field_pn_ff_time_1 [#type_name] => progress_note )  [#field_name] => field_pn_ff_time_1 [#tree] => 1 [#weight] => 4 [#access] => 1 [#count] => 5 )  Let the array name be x . Now let me walk through this associative array in PHP . $x[&lsquo;#theme&rsquo;] , $x[&lsquo;#title&rsquo;] etc . Now we where looking to get the value of hours , minutes etc of the array duration . The &lsquo;#default_value&rsquo; was a Duration object .  So here comes the solution for you .  <strong>$x[0][&lsquo;#default_value&rsquo;]&ndash;>duration[&lsquo;hours&rsquo;]</strong> . You can assign values or get values of this array . I spend some hours to make this small code work. So thought of publishing this for some one who is in search for an example like this . This was a small debugging from Drupal .   $x[&lsquo;#tree&rsquo;] , $x[&lsquo;0&rsquo;][&lsquo;#type&rsquo;] are some other example to retrieve value from this multidimensional array . The example above is used to get the value from the object . Cheers guys and Have a great day .</p>
