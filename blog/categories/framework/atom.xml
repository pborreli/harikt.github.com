    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may be knowing that I have been playing with <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">Aura</a> components for the past few months . The Aura is a PHP 5.3 collection of library . Its the next major release of Solar PHP framework of Paul M Jones. If you want to use it as a framework the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/system">system</a> makes it possible. Aura uses dependency injection in the core .  I have been trying different things with the aura , testing, fixing some bugs if any and pull to it etc . Currently I have an example repo which will help you to get started .  <a href="https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers">Bridge.Careers</a> contains different branches, the ViewHelper branch will help you to learn how to create your own view helpers . The MInSrc branch is set of Model related files you want to integrate Aura.Sql in the Aura framework . In the branch the models reside in the src folder itself .  You may also see other branches in the coming days.  Play with it and let us know what you have in your mind .  <a href="https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers">https://github.com/harikt/Bridge.Careers</a>  Code of Aura PHP : <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a>  Aura PHP Website : <a href="http://auraphp.github.com/">http://auraphp.github.com/</a>  Still have some components missing( I mean Porting the Solar components ), but don&rsquo;t worry we will be coming with it in the coming days, or you can even contribute to it. You can join and discuss with us in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp">http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp</a> or in #auraphp irc channel at freenode.net .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2010/02/01/symfony-live-2010-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started learning symfony after some of my experiments with zend framework and others . So I think I want to write something about the symfony live conference which will be held on February 15 to 17th of 2010 .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4323132806/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4323132806_78a0d70d8e.jpg" alt="symfony live conference" /></a>  Be part of the symfony live 2010 as symfony 2 will be revealed . There are lots of sessions by core players of git , zend , doctrine etc . Get more information about schedule from <a href="http://www.symfony-live.com/schedule">http://www.symfony-live.com/schedule</a> .  Symfony project is supported by sensio labs . The lead developer and owner of symfony framework . Awesome community supported project . Available in MIT licence. Lots of other stand alone components are available for php developers from symfony. YAML , Dependency injection ,Templating , Event Dispatcher, Request handler etc.  Why I started learning symfony ?  Some of you may be interested to know why I started to learn symfony . After recognising the beneficts of MVC I thought of learning an open-source MVC framework. Though I was interested to learn symfony I was forced to move with Zend . Though it is documented , some one who comes without much knowledge of MVC will be weired. It was missing a good example .  Though I developed a sample application I was not feeling much comfortable to work with zend. And at that time I came to know about the presentation by Fabien Potentier &ldquo;using symfony and zend&rdquo; . Many people tried to convince me about the beneficts moving with zend for zend is the PHP company . But if you are not comfortable enough then I think its not good to go with that right ? ( Especially when there is none to help you ).  I was interested to see the auto generation of codes by symfony. I am a GNU/Linux user, so I used to work on command line. Working with symfony is really awesome . If you are a command line guy then you too will defnitely love symfony. Recently I came to know about the PHP bangalore users meet up was having a framework shootout . I would have been there if I was in Bangalore. But I missed that too . If anyone missed that session there is one more chance to get trained with symfony . Yes there is a new symfony bangalore group started <a href="http://www.symfony-bangalore.org">http://www.symfony-bangalore.org</a> .  You can get more information from <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">http://www.symfony-project.org/</a> about the symfony project.  Stand alone components are available from <a href="http://components.symfony-project.org/">http://components.symfony-project.org/</a> .  You will be hearing about lots of interesting open-source projects like swift-mailer , doctrine , twig etc .  I may be using zend components in the future, but anyway not now ;) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2010/01/22/benefits-open-source-frameworks-over-custom-frameworks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4294304881/" title="opensource_logo by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4294304881_87b173eb57_t.jpg" alt="opensource_logo" /></a>Recently I was arguing with one of my friend over the beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom . I know there may be lots of posts describing the beneficts and drawbacks . But I just thought of writing it as I can say I have written about that in my blog. You can check it out .  I hope every one knows about <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">opensource</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">licences</a> . I have been using and learning some of the most popular opensource frameworks like zend, lithium , drupal etc . So lets move on to what are the beneficts I feel .  Beneficts of open source :  1 ) Mainly community supported .  2 ) Coding standards will be followed .  3 ) Throughly tested and immediate patches will be available if any thing breaks .  4 ) Can get quick help from the community .  5 ) Flexible for maintaince ( ie not throw away prototyping )  6 ) Many do unit testing using the popular test tools like phpunit , simpletest etc .  Beneficts of custom :  1 ) Custom frameworks may be good for a developer as he knows what he has written . I don&rsquo;t think there is much beneficts for users .  Drawbacks of custom frameworks :  1 ) It will be developed by a single or some group of people.  2 ) May be tested by some group of peoples , but lacks the tests done by community ( mass of people )  3 ) Developing from scratch is not a big deal , but maintainence is the one that&rsquo;s costly than development . When its custom made , you may need to get the exact people for that . Else its like &ldquo;too many cooks spoil the broothe&rdquo;. Pretty enough community developers, so not a big deal to get one.  4 ) May or may not be flexible . For example lets compare with drupal . When you starts your project , you may have thought just a small blog , then later you thought of having forums , after that you thought you need to sell some goods.  When its drupal like framework , its easy as you just need to maintain the common code base which comes with much of the features and some other contributed and custom modules will make everything fine . But when its custom , you may need to mess with the code , or may need to go extending it , which is not so easy like drupal or any other .  These are what I feel for now . May be more points , but for the time I am not remebering it . If any one feels I missed any , please add your comments I will update it .</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Somethiing about Kohana and Lithium PHP framework]]></title>
    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-22T21:14:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg" alt="kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr" /></a>I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can <a href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries">import zend framework libraries in Kohana</a> . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the <a href="http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/">tutorial of Kohana 3</a> which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5 framework" /></a>That&rsquo;s all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don&rsquo;t know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a> . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270">to codeigniter guys</a> &ldquo;Dear #CodeIgniter People, Don&rsquo;t you care that it&rsquo;s almost 2010 and you&rsquo;re still running PHP4 code? Yours, &ndash; Nate&rdquo; and he got a <a href="http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250">reply from Chris Cornutt</a> of <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> &ldquo;@nateabele it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)&rdquo; . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version <del>0.5</del> 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don&rsquo;t remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions</a> . You can see how fast its moving .</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Frameworks in PHP]]></title>
    <link href="http://harikt.com/blog/2009/03/21/24-frameworks-in-php/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-21T08:25:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.com/blog/2009/03/21/24-frameworks-in-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was hearing about frameworks for more than 1 year . I was having good touch with Jose. I used to ask my doubts and he has helped me a lot. It was from his mouth I heard about framework. When he used to tell about the framework in PHP I was not much aware about , what a framework is , what it can do &hellip;&hellip;.  He used to talk about the symfony-project . When I was going for the first interview in PHP , I called Jose and Victor George one of my seniors who were working on PHP. They gave me lots of informations. Some of them were related to frameworks , MVC etc. I was really new to PHP, learning the basics, so when reading about it , I don&rsquo;t understand much. Many computer science and Information Technology guys may have heard about the commonly used buzz word OOP ( Object Oriented Programming ). When teachers used to tell us, many of us may not understand , what they are talking about. Yes, they will be telling real word many times when introducing OOP&rsquo;s concept. The OOP approach was made clear when I started learning Java. Yes we will not understand just by reading, but need to work on it, to understand the features and all. This is the same case for Framework. But when I started working on PHP , it was really a mess to write codes each and every time for new projects. So you may have thought about resusable codes. Many of you may be copying codes from one project to another. Now here comes the role of Frameworks.  If you are not planning to move to framework, then its not a big deal. Because framework are used mainly for big projects and where security to be considered. When the projects are small , frameworks may consume time. This is not what I am saying, but from the knowledge what I gained from reading. ( Updated : Working in a framework will not increase security , the coder must be aware of it <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />  ) So if you are not using frameworks , you can try the Manuel Lemo&rsquo;s form validation class. This is a great class with good examples and all. You will love the features , if you start using it. Its good for the client and server side validation . Many of the problems that arise to the forms can be rectified by this wonderful class. You can get the class from phpclasses.org .  Php classes , pear etc have a great collection of classes, which you can use and can make a small framework of your own. But what about security and all ?I too was not much aware of the security and other issues, but after exploring each day , I learned something new.  I thought of learning a framework. I was looking here and there , to get a good one. I mailed to my friends who are working in PHP to help me select a good one. Some of the PHP frameworks in the list where, symfony , zend-framework , phpcake, Yii Framework . One of my friend Rajeev is working on symfony . He told its a little bit harder to learn . But I thought of moving to symfony , as I will be getting help from my friends too <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.Not only that , but its being used in the dailymotions , delicious of yahoo . Symfony has many inbuilt functions like testing, security , model view controller etc . It may take some time , to learn symfony. The first tutorial was a wondeful one , with how much ease you can create a blog. Wow its simply superb . So if you know it properly you can build quickly .  Some of the functions are automatic admin generation , many plugins available. I was thinking after seeing the first tutorail , why I have not started learning sysmfony.  Its too late . &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. need some sleep .  Bye and Have a great day .</p>
